            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That men might be holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and righteous to others, underſtanding what is their own, and to do well to themſelves and to all men, that they and others might be happy. He that can diſcern and judge rightly of theſe things, is an Oracle amongſt men, and fit for all buſineſs in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>Other knowledge is very good,<note place="margin">Laws.</note> and greatly ornamental and uſeful in its kind; but this Learning of <hi>Laws</hi> divine and humane, excells all the reſt, as the Sun the Stars, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Piety, Equity and Reaſon that is in it, and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite uſe and benefit that redounds by it to Soul and Body, to Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Societies for this life and for a better.</p>
                  <p>I undervalue no Learning hereby, but give every Art its due in its time and place; and ſo I give this ſublime Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Laws its due alſo: Hereby I do no more than
<pb facs="tcp:49664:3"/> perſwade to chooſe the beſt things, and to find out the moſt excellent waies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Jural ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>In order therefore to the underſtanding of the Scriptures, which are Gods Laws, I prefer the <hi>Jural ſenſe</hi> as moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and kindly, and make uſe of Jural Terms borrowed from Laws Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, in their proper ſtyle, as moſt homogeneal and ſutable to the Divine Law, in which God hath condeſcended to humane capacities by propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Will in the nature of Laws, by his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and this is the moſt ſtately eloquence for all buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>There are in the Scriptures, which are the two Laws and Teſtaments of God publiſhed by the two Mediators <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cceſſories and Conſequences as Hiſtories and Prophecies, to the explaining whereof Philoſophy and Chronology may be very helpful. But for the principal and eſſential Will, Word, Law, Covenant, Teſtament of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mans ſalvation by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, let any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perſon judge, whether it be not expreſly revealed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, eſpecially St. <hi>Paul</hi> that great Divine and Lawyer, as that other Teſtament by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in terms of Law. Such as <hi>Predeſtination, Election, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, Faith, Grace, Gift, Covenant, Will, Teſtament, Heir, Inheritance, Poſſeſſion, Liberty, &amp;c.</hi> as ſhall be made more largely to appear hereafter.</p>
                  <p>So the Laws of God being deſcribed in terms of Law after the manner of Men, are more aptly interpreted by the Science of Law, than of Philoſophy or any other Art what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. This I lay as a principle and foundation to my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Title of Scripture.</note>There is nothing more ordinary in our Diſcourſes and Writings than the Laws and Teſtaments of God, which are the Titles of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and yet how few regard the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe ſo conſiderable Titles? For the Subject of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book is beſt apprehended by the full Name and Title that is given to it, expreſſing the Nature of the thing contained in it.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49664:3"/>
                  <p>But becauſe this is a New untrodden path, and that I am almoſt alone in this Manner of ſpeaking, therefore unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and undiſtinguiſhing men, that are lazy withal and hang upon others Judgments, are ſhie of this Way and paſs it by, giving it no good report. The terms of Philoſophy and Oratory are pleaſantly ſwallowed down by them, becauſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual; but the terms of both Laws ſtick and will not go down, as harſh and crabbed.</p>
                  <p>Sure this doth mightily betray the Ignorance of theſe men: I do not uſe any barbarous words, as are in ſome Laws, but the pure and elegant expreſſions of the beſt of humane Laws, far more learned and ſignificant than the froth of Rhetoricians, or the Fuſtian ſtuff of Schoolmen, or the Canting, <hi>Roſicrucian,</hi> Enthuſiaſtick nonſenſe of Fanaticks.</p>
                  <p>This is our ſhame, that ſo many Divines and Lawyers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that moſt illuſtrious Faculty, ſo highly uſeful to them and to the Nobles and Princes of the World, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon whereof all other inferiour Arts are pedantick and baſe.</p>
                  <p>I take them to be the beſt Divines,<note place="margin">Diſtinction of Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that diſtinguiſh beſt between the Old Teſtament and the New; that preach the New Teſtament and not the Old, the Spirit and not the Letter, the power of Godlineſs and not the form.</p>
                  <p>A clear diſtinction between the two Teſtaments, the Law and the Goſpel, I take to be the principal excellency of a Divine, and a noble vein that ſhould run through every The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Treatiſe. For which I note the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Hugo Grotius, Dr. Hammond, Dr. Taylor, Dr. Luſhington, Dr. Spencer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farindon, &amp;c.</hi> to be the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in giving light to this great Point, which deſerves to be more enquired into: For which cauſe I have offered my poor Endeavours, hoping to find acceptance from all ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and free ſpirited men.</p>
                  <p>Such divine Lawyers as theſe I take to have the ſoundeſt Notions, and the cleareſt and fulleſt Expreſſions; no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the World knows it.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49664:4"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Legiſts.</note>The Linguiſts, and Diſputants, and Humaniſts make much ado with their Criticiſms, and ſubtilties, and Fineries; but 'tis the wiſe <hi>Legist</hi> that muſt do the buſineſs in Church and State. A wiſe Juriſconſult, in my opinion, knows more of Religion, Equity and Government, than the profoundeſt <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt, Ariſtotelian,</hi> or <hi>Ciceronian</hi> of them all.</p>
                  <p>I admire the moſt Excellent <hi>Grotius</hi> for his rare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in all things, but eſpecially for his wiſdom in the Laws both divine and humane, which makes him ſhine among all other Writers:<note place="margin">H. Grotius.</note> 
                     <hi>Tanquam Luna inter minora ſidera.</hi> And thence ſpring thoſe incomparable Notions digeſted by a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and moderate ſpirit, his Enemies being Judges. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Currs bawl about him, that mighty Giant, of whom the World was not worthy, and ſpare not to abuſe him now he is in his grave, who were not worthy to carry his Books after him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe are the Men that divide the Word of God aright, like workmen that need not to be aſhamed; clearly unfolding the good will of God, without taking any ſide or party, wholly aiming at ſatisfaction to all Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the peace and reconciliation of all Sects, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plain Promiſes of God in the New and laſt Teſtament of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Humour poſſeſſes many that hug themſelves for their wiſdom and moderation therein, That, either the Will of God concerning Man's Election to ſalvation is inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or if not,<note place="margin">Will of God.</note> muſt be kept ſecret from the people; or at leaſt moſt tenderly toucht upon, as being ſo harſh and grating that it would drive the hearers into deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Let any Rational man judge, that is to be free to uſe his Judgment, whether this be fair dealing or no. Whether it is likely that God's Will is ſtill kept ſecret now Chriſt Jeſus is come in the fleſh; or whether, if revealed by God, it ſhould be kept ſecret by men; or whether it be ſo hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as few or none know what to make of it; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if underſtood, or ſo much of it as is underſtood, it be ſo rigid and ſharp that no body cares to hear it.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49664:4"/>
                  <p>Will any wiſe man make a Teſtament that no body ſhall be able to underſtand? Will any good man make a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that few or none ſhall be the better for, nay much the worſe? How then ſhall we dare to think that the moſt wiſe, and juſt, and gracious God hath done after this faſhion? or which is worſe, that he hath indeed made a fair and pleaſing Will to all Mankind for ſalvation, inviting them to Holineſs in order thereunto, but hath reſerved a ſecret Will to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite contrary, which no body muſt queſtion, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body muſt follow his outward Will, though by the inward Will they are bound up for the generality by an Eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, never to do that Righteouſneſs, nor enjoy that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they are exhorted and intreated to do and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. I ſay again, If this be fair dealing let the world judge. They talk of handling the word of God deceitfully; I pray, what ſhall we call this way of handling it, when they teach that men are decreed to a Number to be good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, ſinful and miſerable inevitably, <hi>i. e.</hi> againſt their wills.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Humour poſſeſſeth thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That whatſoever the Will of God was from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſome diſputing it to be Abſolute, others Conditional, few or none take care to preach it. But all their Guides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the Maſſe and other Sacraments, and urge Auſterities and Penances, of Whippings, Pilgrimages, &amp;c. And direct them to pray to Saints departed,<note place="margin">Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> by ceremonies and offerings to their Shrines, Images and Reliques; and grant them large Indulgences for mony, and Dirges and Maſſe for releaſing their Souls out of Purgatory. And in theſe and all other their Heatheniſh ſhews and Pageantries, amuſe the ſimple ſort with Certainty of ſalvation upon the implicite Faith of the Church, and the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> injoyned to merit Heaven by. And ſo they go away clearly to heaven to rights, without any more ado.</p>
                  <p>A man would admire that Learned men ſhould be ſuch knaves, to practice and teach ſuch a blind Religion; and that the Laity ſhould be ſuch ſlaves, to uſe no Judgment of their
<pb facs="tcp:49664:5"/> own, but to ſubmit to ſuch unreaſonable Fopperies. But let theſe and ſuch like look to themſelves, I ſhall go another way to work.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers, Ancient witneſſes of the Truth, Men of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, have reliſhed of the Eloquence, Philoſophy and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the Heathens amongſt whom they were bred, as <hi>Origen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fathers.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> Others retained much of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> as well as <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> after their converſion to the Chriſtian Religion. Later men having good wits, did ill employ them in making knots,<note place="margin">Schoolmen.</note> in railing and beggarly confutations of adverſe parties, toſſing the Ball to and fro, diſparaging the labours of deſerving men, an odious way; Others flie aloft and hover in the clouds, and loſe themſelves in <hi>Roſicrucian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Roſicrucians.</note> Metaphyſical Idea's and ſpeculations. All this while ſuch a duſt is raiſed round about, that the plain truth of Faith and honeſty is obſcured and groped after: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the great kindneſs and love of God were fairly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the World without tricks or legerdemain,<note place="margin">Promiſes preached.</note> God would be glorified, Souls would embrace the Promiſes, and be in covenant with their God, and inherit everlaſting life. Then would the free people of God be ſubject to his laws, and not remain in bondage to humane ordinances; <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not;</hi> nor to Will-worſhip of Saints or Angels; then would all unneceſſary diſputes ceaſe, all caſes of Conſciences be reſolved,<note place="margin">Pacification.</note> all Sects and Hereſies be united, the ſpiritual worſhip and power of Godlineſs advanced, all jealouſies removed, and the world would be at peace and quiet. Becauſe the fiery and unquiet ſpirits of men are tamed and ſettled by the ſpirit of the Goſpel, and the <hi>Lion</hi> will feed and couch with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and they ſhall learn no kind of war any more.</p>
                  <p>This were a rare Attempt, however it ſhould ſucceed, for God's glory, the Worlds good, and the honour of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, though they bring all the proud Diſputers of the Schools about their ears. For this purpoſe I would blow the Trumpet fain, ſo to rowſe up the ſpirits of learned and
<pb facs="tcp:49664:5"/> meek men for peace, as others have done for war. I am ſure in this doing I chooſe the better part, which ſhall never be taken away from me. And let God work his will, however I and thoſe of my genius will long for it, and endeavour after it, at leaſt to ſatisfie and comfort our own Souls, and convince the world, or rather the wiſer ſort, that ſuch a way and means there is to be uſed if they would but look after it.</p>
                  <p>This way and Means,<note place="margin">Means to underſtand Scripture.</note> I take to be the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the laſt Will and Teſtament of God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In order to this way of Pacification, I humbly, under God, apply my ſelf to be a Diſciple to the beſt of men, that labour to know and teach, what things are to be had or done in Rule and Government, in duty and action for Souls, how to make them wiſe and juſt; for Bodies, how to make and keep them ſafe and ſound; for Eſtates, how to get, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, increaſe and uſe them for ſociety of cohabitation and commerce, at home and abroad, in peace and war, for this life and for a better. Which do all the buſineſſes of Souls, Bodies and Eſtates in Church and State, the reſt are but as Cyphers in compariſon of them.</p>
                  <p>Such are our meer <hi>Grammarians, Oratours, Criticks, Poets, Muſicians, Sophiſters, Linguiſts, &amp;c.</hi> that ſerve for <hi>Loves, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, Entertainments, Recreations, Revels, Triumphs, Births, Marriages, Inſtalments, Funerals, Pomps, Diſſentions, Interests, Parties</hi> and <hi>Factions;</hi> by their <hi>Panegyricks, Epithalamiums, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legies, Disputes, &amp;c.</hi> while thoſe Sacred <hi>Myſtae</hi> by their braver ſpirits are raiſed up to give their attendance at the holy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of Religion and Juſtice, performing all the higher, more ſerious and profitable ſervices in Church and State, as the <hi>Ambaſſadors of God,</hi> the <hi>Counſel of Souls,</hi> the <hi>Priests of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Equity,</hi> the <hi>Legates of Princes and States,</hi> the <hi>Guides of Souls in all religious and civil Tranſactions,</hi> by their <hi>Preaching, Praying, Praiſing, Pleading, Judging, Treating and Executing of Laws Divine and Humane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have reaſon therefore, I think, to wave the lazineſs of
<pb facs="tcp:49664:6"/> ſuch men of good Talents, but not improving them to the beſt advantage, but ſtaying behind in the enjoyment of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar notions, content themſelves with Vulgar errors.</p>

                  <p>This may be granted perhaps in <hi>Philoſophy, Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and in Mechanick Arts, as of <hi>Navigation, &amp;c.</hi> but to aſſert any improvement in Divinity will be thought <hi>Hereſie, Schiſm,</hi> or <hi>Innovation</hi> at the leaſt, which is counted dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Principles ſure.</note>As for the Foundations and Principles of Faith, there is no doubt but they alwaies have been, and are, and will be the ſame; but for the ſuperſtructures and conſequences, they are now by Diſcerning men more clearly drawn out for Spiritual advantages, than ever they were before by a more perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures, without the mixture of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or the Doctrines of Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſtianity unmixt.</note>The Reaſon is, becauſe at the firſt <hi>Christianity</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly revealed by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, who with him taught the purity and perfection of Divine worſhip, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſpenſation, and the Wiſdom of the world. But this Treaſure after their daies was a little hid, yea, in the Apoſtles daies this miſchief began to work, which was by them wiſely obſerved, eſpecially by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in all his Epiſtles, eſpecially to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> clears up the abſolute independent neceſſity of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> without <hi>Moſes</hi> and the help of vain Philoſophy, againſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenizing</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49664:6"/> Chriſtians. But in the daies of their Diſciples and their Succeſſors, the ſtreams that aroſe from pure fountains, ran farther through the channels of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm:</hi> and though they kept themſelves in their own nature unmixt, and do ſtill, yet Men of weak Judgments, through Ignorance, and of Corrupt minds, through too much Worldly wiſdom, did, and do taſte too much of their own muddy waters, and keep the ſavour of them, as is apparent in their Expreſſions and Superſtitions to this very day.</p>
                  <p>And why then ſhould not ſome, if they can,<note place="margin">Aſpire to perfection.</note> be wiſer and honeſter too than ſome? Muſt we be always Children, dwell always upon beggarly Elements, be always biaſſed by Parties and Sides for favour and gain? The older the World is, it ſhould grow the wiſer, and not ſtand at a ſtay. It is no Soleciſm to ſay, <hi>We are elder (in our Generations) than our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and have more experience than our Teachers, and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Diſciples will be wiſer than we: And that Antiquity which we ſo admire and trust unto, is Junior and Neoterick properly to us. The first Ages are the Youth of the World in their Minority, but we are the Antients and Adult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are beholding to them, and they would now, if alive, be beholding to us. Neither are the Truths among them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at all, but the ſame far better underſtood and kept pure by themſelves, and enlarged to more profitable uſes.</p>
                  <p>It is a dull thing to fit ſtill like Children, and venture no farther than we have been taught to go. All men have not the ſame drowzy ſpirits; all men will not be ſo contented; Some men will put on lively, and try to add ſomething more upon the old ſtock, and not ſuffer themſelves to be led by the noſe: as for thoſe that will be deceived, there is no remedy, let them be deceived.</p>
                  <p>And they are for the moſt part of theſe kinds;<note place="margin">Vain Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> Such as for oſtentation heap up variety of Learning from vain and unneceſſary <hi>Logick, Philoſophy, Hiſtory, Tongues, Mathematicks, Antiquities, &amp;c.</hi> and little regard <hi>Morality</hi> for life and action to govern themſelves and others. Hence they become Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

                  <p>Theſe profound Sages with other folks learning, as the Bird with ſtrange feathers, or the <hi>Aſſe</hi> with the <hi>Lion's</hi> skin, are mightily elevated with their great Parts of Memory and Utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

                  <p>He that follows his own ſound Reaſon without favour and affection to any extream, and does his work as is pleaſing to his own mind, with his own well choſen and diſpoſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, ſhall make a far better ſtructure, than he that buſily collects ſeveral materials of ſeveral mens framing and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, which being all jumbled together muſt needs be botching.</p>
                  <p>A man's own clear Notions, maturely diſpoſed, fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in genuine terms, is his beſt Wiſdom and moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Rhetorick.</p>

                  <p>A ſtructure ſtrongly and uſefully contrived, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſerviceable and agreeable ſtuff, is better than a Medly or Hotchpotch gawdily painted without frame or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>
                  <p>Still he that builds for his own conveniences, and is neat in his own Neſt, proſecutes his own end, and uſes the means accordingly. But ſeveral mens fancies and contrivances, eſpecially wanting Art, do not fit the ſcope of one Man's work.</p>
                  <p>That therefore which we call <hi>Learning acquired,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing in it ſelf; but unleſs a man have ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and moderation and meekneſs withal to uſe it, it will cheat him unreaſonably: For he will, as <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and be puffed up with his vaſt knowledg and memory, and will think he hath all Judgment, and count himſelf an Oracle to foretel all Contingencies, and reſolve all Difficulties, when a plain honeſt man of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall ſee farther into a Milſtone than he.</p>
                  <p>But if withal this full-fraught perſon can brave it out with the fine come off and twang of a golden Tongue,<note place="margin">Eloquence.</note> he ſhall catch the Vulgar by the ears. All he ſaies or does ſhall be Goſpel; the ſimple Rout ſhall hang upon his lips, and he will hug himſelf with the Excellencies that are in him, and drain the purſes of the Rich of poor apprehenſion.

The Common Truths are enough for him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for his capacity, and they that go farther, he ſays, will ſpeed worſe; and things dear bought and far fetcht are good for Ladies, and ſuch are counted fools for their pains, or worſe, that trouble themſelves to underſtand more than their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>In a word, a ſmooth Tongue and well hung to let flie at any thing, ſhall jangle and deſcant upon any tune; but a judicious ear finds out the jars and diſcords therein. A man may colour over a rotten Poſt, rant it highly in the
<pb facs="tcp:49664:8"/> Pulpit, and carry all afore him; but when all comes to be ſcan'd by a judicious and diſcerning Soul, it cannot poſſibly hold water.</p>
                  <p>With all this their Learning they are not wiſe, and how can theſe men be honeſt all this while I'de very fain know, that preach what they know cannot be juſtified; but for gain and applauſe they hold it out, and rail at honeſt and judicious men, that ſpeak home and plainly as they ſhould do, though they get not the wealth and glory which they have.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch are our ſyſtematical Methodmongers, blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in their <hi>Dichotomies</hi> after the way of <hi>Ramus</hi> or <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And ſuch are our more aery and ſubtil Schoolmen, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring in the way of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> and ſuch are our fluent long winded Orators, expatiating in the way of <hi>Cicero:</hi> and ſuch are our ſublime, intoxicated, Enthuſiaſtick <hi>Behemiſts</hi> and <hi>Roſtcrucians:</hi> and ſuch are our whining Devotioniſts, floating in their blind and zealous Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>I bear them record, they are good and well-meaning Souls, and if they would but uſe their own Judgments might prove excellent Doctors.</p>

I need premiſe no more; the Reader may eaſily obſerve all along throughout the whole diſcourſe this vein runs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the Law from the Goſpel: A point, I humbly conceive, which as it much conduces to the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures, in dividing the word of God aright, in which appears the wonderful and manifold Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Moſt High: So is the Intereſt and Peace of the Church much to be promoted thereby, and more than by any other courſe that hath been taken hitherto.

I had rather utter a ſound Reaſon, than an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without reaſon. I avoid all riming reaſons, and quaint diſtinctions and alluſions, and quirks and flouriſhes. I count it Pedantical to interrupt a continued diſcourſe with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded phraſes, or inlaid adagies and ſentences of other men, when the Author himſelf may ſpeak the ſame ſenſe in his own, as good or better words for his purpoſe, without pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or racking his natural genius.</p>
                  <p>If therefore I have laid my foundation ſtrong, or made my building uniform with good lights and chambers, and neceſſary offices therein, and have ſeated it from the injury of weather. I have ſatisfied my ſelf, and may ſatisfie all equal and ingenious Judges, though I have wanted Carvers and Painters to ſet out the Fabrick with <hi>Antiques,</hi> or other curious Imagery. The true end of ſtately ſtructures and veſſels of Precious matter, is to be uſeful, plain and goodly for aſpect, artificial ſymmetry and true compoſure, though not all over enamelled and powdered with ſparks of Diamonds, Gems, or gaiety of Sculptures.</p>
                  <p>Surely a pure, ſmooth, flowing ſtyle,<note place="margin">True Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> ſolidly and clearly expreſſing ſound matter in genuine words and a natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is the beſt conveyance and inſinuation of Doctrine into the Judgment of the Learners, and the beſt motive to ſtir up their affections.

                  <p>Thus I have given an account, as I ought, of the purpoſe and ſcope which I aim at in this enſuing Diſcourſe, and of the ſtyle and phraſe therein uſed. For which, if any
<pb facs="tcp:49664:12"/> brand me for an Opiniator, Noveliſt, Legiſt, Neuter, or any other Nick-name they can invent, I retort nothing, but hope in time they may come to their wits, and be free to uſe their own Judgments as I have done, and then they will tell me another ſtory. Farewel.</p>

                     <hi>THE Standard of this whole Book: OR,</hi> A Grain of Salt to ſeaſon every Propoſition therein.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Firſt light of Nature well obſerved, and better improved, creates a knowledg moſt kindly and ſimilary to the common ſenſe and genius of Mankind; and is the moſt certain, infallible, faireſt and freeſt way of reaſoning and perſwading, without ſubtilties and ſophiſtries of <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> falſly ſo called.</p>
                  <p>By this Firſt light and law of Nature we do well and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand our whole duty to God and to our Neighbour: And are thereby capacitated to receive the Second light and law of Revelations into our minds, and facilitated to embrace Divine impulſes upon our wills, and every way to be fitted for Chriſtian perfections.</p>
                  <p>Without this plain Rule and Guide (which ſome Learned men ſcorn, and moſt men take little notice of) all ſorts of men fall upon incertainties, and believe little; but fluctuate much in empty and vaſt ſpeculations, and warp to every Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Idea, embracing the cloud of Error for real Truth; without this we grope and wander in the dark.</p>
                  <p>If this ſolid foundation of prime, natural, eaſie Truths were well laid, the Conſequences agreeing together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling one another in their Principles, would be known as Daughters by their faces, and the features and tempers of their common Mother.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49664:9"/>
                  <p>But Learned men are to blame to admire, as they do, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wild, new and rare, above the vulgar ken, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to no common foundation, deſiring to ſtoop ſo low, as to dig out of thoſe natural veins the precious minerals contained in them; but flie to Chymical extractions of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of lead and iron, and neglect the true ore, becauſe every Bungling operator, they think, can do that; But they would erect a Laboratory of Furnaces and Limbecks, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract more than the Sun can do out of the rich maſs of the earthy and watry Globe.</p>
                  <p>In a word, They reach at all things, and catch nothing. The great Scholar loſes the day, when the illiterate Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt carries the Truth in triumph upon his naked ſhoulders:</p>
                  <p>This Firſt knowledge is as the Alphabet in all Books, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in all other knowledg. A Light to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures, and all other Sciences.</p>
                  <p>This is the root, ſpring, and foundation of all Arts, and without this we learn nothing.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge wanteth no other, but all others want it.</p>
                  <p>This preſuppoſeth no <hi>Grammar, Logick, Philoſophy,</hi> nor any of the Liberal Sciences; but they preſuppoſe this, as the firſt and neceſſary Art that ordereth all others, to the good ends of truth and happineſs: Becauſe it teacheth man to know God, and to know himſelf, and to do as he would be done by; to know why he is made, and by whom, and to whom he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged. And except a man do know theſe things, what will all other knowledge profit him?</p>
                  <p>This is eaſily learned, without other helps, and is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily forgotten. This makes a man cheerful, humble, liberal, juſt, obedient, to hate all vice, and love all vertue, and it puffs not up at all.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge argues by infallible Arguments, ſuch as no body can deny, becauſe every man feels them true by his own experience within himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge ſeems at the firſt to be very vile and low, and of no ſtrength, becauſe it begins from the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:49664:9"/> as the Mathematicks do, which every one is apt to ſlight; but at laſt, the high and noble fruits being diſcerned in the true knowledge of God and Man, makes them of another mind: Becauſe by how much the more low the foundation is laid, in eaſie and terreſtrial things, by ſo much the more lofty the ſtructure is raiſed in hard and celeſtial matters:</p>
                  <p>Other knowledge is contrived, in methods and terms Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick and unintelligible; it puffeth up, and the Profeſſors and Scholars of ſeveral Faculties fall together by the ears, and are never the wiſer nor the more honeſt at all; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon themſelves and the world of Fools, that are willing to be cheated: Which kind of ſlavery is abhorred and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed by all liberal and noble Spirits. So they moſt Majeſtically in their chains and purple Robes, determine undeterminable things, triumphing as the maſters and conquerers of all Truth. And can you blame them, ſeeing that by this craft they get their living?</p>
                  <p>Let it not be grievous therefore for theſe high <hi>Lytae,</hi> and ſtately Regents, to ſtoop down to this inferiour Science, as they deem it, becauſe it is more profitable for them than all their ſublime Arts and Sciences can be without it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it precedes all other wiſdom, even the ſacred Scriptures themſelves, <hi>Quoad nos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſtrong Foundation, well laid, will bear up ſtoutly all that ſhall be fairly built upon it. This plain Rule will try the truth of every Propoſition. There will be no tottering Hypotheſes, nor crooked Concluſions, if the analogy and proportion of Natural truths be faithfully inſpected and followed. We may all agree in all main things, if we would all look this way, and fairly comply in theſe Principles; Amphibologies, Equivocations, Diſtinctions, Fallacies, Tropes and Figures, will be found as ſo many vizards and fucus's, to caſt a miſt before the eye of the Mind, and darken the clear light of the Underſtanding, and ſo in time will be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by all wiſe men.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49664:10"/>
                  <p>This is the Light, under God, by which together with the Supernatural light thereupon, I have wrote theſe things, not without many failings, God knows; and by the ſame Lights they are to be examined and underſtood, or not at all. For I have had no other meaning, than what is contained in natural and ſupernatural Revelations; whatſoever is more than theſe is Error. By theſe 'tis ſafe to abide, and as ſafe to be tried. And ſo every man may judge and ſatisfie himſelf, in his own and others Notions, as well as he can, and be content. And this is all that can be done, when all is done.</p>
                  <p>Do but bring all things to the common Teſt, touchſtone, and ſtandard of this Light of natural and ſupernatural Law, and we ſhall all quickly meet, agree kindly, and pardon one anothers miſtakes, and be in a fairer way of mending all that is amiſs every day more and more. This is the way to truth and peace.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! Proud men ſtrongly intereſted for honour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and riches; Ignorant men, Self-conceited men, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, Flatterers and Lazy men, that reſolve to ſtick to their education and practice, and the ſentiments of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, with the Examples and Doctrines of their admired Maſters, will never go this way to work while the World ſtands. There is therefore no remedy for theſe things, but Patience. The World it is to be hoped, will grow older and wiſer; but ſtill there muſt be errors and ſects for the trial of ſteady and unbiaſſed Souls; and the Truth at laſt, will be no loſer thereby.</p>

All which gracious Diſpoſitions, are actually conveyed to all that have gotten a right to them by Faith, through the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious working of the Mediator and Executor, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

So do Chymiſts extract moſt exquiſite Salts, Elixirs and Spirits by their workings in the way, although they never come, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will, to the Philoſophers Stone in the end.</p>

And when they have done all that they can, they have done like men, and let thoſe that can, mend it, as well as they can, and pardon thoſe that could not do ſo well as they, or as others ſhould do. For when we have ſaid or done all that we can, we muſt all acknowledg that we are in the dark.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>It is common for Mathematicians to boaſt, that they have monopolized all Demonſtrations to their own Arts, and all other Arts produce nothing but Probabilities. Yet I could challenge the beſt Mathematician of them all in Uranometry or Geometry to demonſtrate an exact menſuration of the Celeſtial or Terreſtrial Bodies to the laſt fraction of a fraction in every Degree, Digit, Minute or Scruple, or that they can ſo much as draw a ſtraight Line, or frame a Global Circle without the leaſt gibboſity or conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity therein, as may be diſcovered by the help of a Magnifying Glaſs pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Beams of the Sun; for our eyes of themſelves are not ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly good as to diſcern them.</p>
                     <p>I do not know but that the Bee can work the orbicular doors to her pentagonal Cells without any irregularity; and ſo may ſome other works be ſtrictly curious by the Inſtinct of Nature, as are the gallant flowers, &amp;c. But let the Rational Eye or Hand ſhew ſuch Perfections, Ile dare them to it, if they can; <hi>Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know they can come very near, and they are ſo wiſe and ingenious to perceive and confeſs, that it is impoſſible for them to be infallible in their operations.</p>
                     <p>This is to feel our ſelves to be but Men, leſt we ſhould be too proud, and to thank God for what we have, and to acknowledg all Perfection to be only in Him.</p>
                     <p>In ſome Moral Demonſtrations, we are able to ſhew a greater Certainty, than any Mechanical Inſtruments, Engins or Workings of curious Arts can bring forth, which come ſhort of ſomething in all their Compoſures and Uſes. But Concluſions rightly framed from neceſſary Propoſitions, cannot err, and therefore do create Science infallible in Moral Entities, which is more than all the Mathematical Demonſtrations in Heaven or Earth, could ever yet make to appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Topicks.</note>I wot full well that there are certain Heads or Topicks, flexible and fallible enough, from which only probable Arguments or Mediums can iſſue, not certain Concluſions, and this makes fine Sport among Young men to exerciſe their Academical wits, but when they come to be older, and to uſe their own Judgments, they will perceive, This is rather to be accounted the Art of Rhetorick than of Logick. For it is good enough for an Orator to uſe ſuch Topicks to perſwade his unjudicious Auditors, with fine Phraſes and the Twang of a Silver Tongue; and this is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all that he cares for to carry Pitchers by the Ears, to give Poyſon a guſto of Honey, and colour over a Leaden Cauſe with a Fucus of Gold. But in the Buſineſs of Mens Souls and Bodies and Eſtates, Divines and Lawyers are to ſearch for ſound Faith and Reaſon, that men may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49664:23"/> what their True Rights are both to Heaven and Earth, and how to enjoy them, and how to keep them for this life, and for a better.</p>
                     <p>Some things in Natures Light are undeniably true and diſcernible by all, but they come ſhort of what is further to be known by Art and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience upon them.</p>
                     <p>And ſome things are revealed in Theology moſt exactly true, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible by all; but there are farther Treaſures of Perfection reſerved in the mind of God, which we are not able to know: And it is very fit we ſhould be kept ſhort, and fed by degrees (and yet not want neceſſaries neither) leſt we ſhould be too lazy and lofty, and think our ſelves Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</p>
                     <p>Knowledg is amiable and deſirable to all; but Prejudice and Pride, and Cuſtome and Slavery, and Idleneſs and Intereſt ſway mightily with Fools and wicked men, and hinder that True Wiſdom which they might have if they would endeavour to be better qualified and prepared to receive it at Gods hands, and learn to manage it well when they have it.</p>
                     <p>Certain Elements therefore and Axioms, I think fir to pitch upon, in this and other Titles for a Foundation to my Superſtructures, and to finiſh them handſomely according to Art and Skill, and this is all that can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected.</p>

                     <p>It ſeemeth therefore abſurd, that theſe Principles, and ſuch as theſe, and what may rationally flow from them, ſhould not be certainly known by men, the practiſe whereof in life and converſation is enjoyned by the Authority of God, as well as thoſe the practiſe whereof in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is forbidden by the Authority of God. If we may and do know ſome things certainly, which may be left unknown by us without damage, Why ſhould we not as certainly know ſome things which are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which are commanded to be known, and if they be not known, we incurr a penalty for not knowing them? And if we cannot know them, how can we do them? and if we cannot know the contrary, how can we avoid them?</p>
                     <p>The World of wiſe men have been too careleſs in the underſtanding of Moral Truths upon a falſe opinion and ſuppoſition received, that there can be no firm or infallible Certainty in them, but only a flexible and falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Probability. And this hath been the cauſe of their ſloath in not ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their excellent wits to work upon the ſearch of them as they might have done, becauſe they found others before them groping in the dark, in great doubts, and they were afraid to look out further, or tread harder upon ſuch ſinking Sands, when as the light was hard by, and the ground firm under them, if they had but dared to venture, and few or none did encourage them, nay others autoritatively bound them up, and charged them not to advance, upon the pain and puniſhment of Hereſie and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion that ſhould fall thereon.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49664:24"/>
                     <p>But God hath not dealt ſo with us, but hath bid us try all things, and hold faſt that which is good, and bids us aſpire to perfection, and ſhews unto us a more excellent way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> a man rarely learned,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> hath done a great deal of miſchief in this kind to learned men, that have tied themſelves up too cloſe to his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, becauſe of his mighty Name for a portentous Wit above all men; which Eſtimation, by a kind of Fatal Errour he hath had for many ages caſt upon him. And that proud Emblem which he hath fixed upon the Frontiſpiece of his Book of Morals, hath frightned moſt men, from all hopes of ever obtaining any more than a Probability.</p>
                     <p>Indeed and in Truth, if we rightly conſider things,<note place="margin">Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> The Subject of a Demonſtration, is the Propoſition to be demonſtrated, that is, in which the neceſſary Connexion of the Predicate with the Subject is to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, by ſome Principle or more general Effatum which muſt contain the Reaſon of that ſo neceſſary Connexion. So that it ſufficeth to make a Demonſtration, if any Thing or Action hath an Attribute or Predicate whoſe neceſſary connexion with the Subject, may by ſome comprehenſive Axiom of undoubted Truth, be mediately or immediately demonſtrated, whether that Action or Thing of its ſelf depends upon neceſſary Cauſes or not.</p>
                     <p>If therefore ſearching Wits would be more free and bold, not without modeſty and fear, to exert their Faculties, they might worthily advance the Commonwealth of Learning, in uſing their great Judgments to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of higher Truths from the plain and prime Principles of Natural and Supernatural Light, obvious to them that, have skill, and want only courage to uſe them. For my own part I acknowledg my own weakneſs to do any great matters; I have attempted to build upon theſe golden Foundations ſuch matter as may be ſuitable and durable in my poor Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I wiſh the ſtupendious Wits of this Age would help me in theſe Eſſayes, and vent their famous thoughts more clearly and largely upon theſe ſo ſtately Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and the like Prime Principles here and elſewhere ſcattered in theſe volumes, are as ſo many Veins and Arteries, Nerves and Fibres from the heart and brain of the Scriptures, inſinuating themſelves, and creeping into all the Parts and Members of this Body to enliven and ſtrengthen the ſame; If there be withal a Symmetry and due proportion therein, it is the chiefeſt Beauty it hath or could have; as for the Colour or outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to ſet it off, to pleaſe the Curioſity of the outward view, it hath few or none; nor did I intend it ſhould, or if I had, I ſhould according to my Genius, induſtriouſly wave all tedious wordings, or dawbing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus upon ſuch Notions as to the Judicious Reader will appear more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am ſure more uſeful without them.</p>
                     <p>I know full well I might have ſhortened theſe Books and Titles very much; That, others may do for themſelves that are more knowing,<note place="margin">The Authors Apology.</note> but the leſs skilful, perhaps would not underſtand my meaning. For to them <hi>dum brevis eſſe laboro, obſcurus fio,</hi> if I ſhould be ſhort, I ſhould be dark. And ſo as I have contrived, by the help of God, I go on with my Work. In which I proteſt to determine nothing magiſterially, but to ſubmit my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment humbly to the Scriptures, and to the judgment of the wiſeſt, freeſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49664:25"/> and moſt moderate opinions from them, which is all in effect that can be ſaid or done to the Worlds end, always reſting ſatisfied with the ſubſtance of all, when all is ſaid that can be ſaid, or done that can be done, namely Faith and a good Conſcience, which are all in all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums.</note>Laſtly, I do not ſay that all theſe Principles are alike uncontrolable, or that (becauſe of their number) ſome of them may interfere.

                     <p>I cannot tell what the matter is, but before I go any further, I muſt needs tell the Reader what troubles me; I cannot be rid of ſome fears, which I have about ſome odd kind of Formaliſts, Opiniators, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſts, ſcornful and peeviſh againſt all that offer the leaſt excurſion out of their old beaten road, or to ſpeak a Dialect which they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.

They'l count it a dull Buſineſs and be quickly weary, where they meet with no ſubtil Diſtinctions, nor Flaſhes, nor flanting gayeties. Serious Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt be very ſhort, Or they throw them by, and are tired before they can get half way. I muſt have other kind of Readers or none: 'Tis a tickliſh Age; I think to venture but this once: I court no body; Let every one pleaſe themſelves, All I deſire is a right underſtanding, and an unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed affection, if this fail now, <hi>Meliùs judicabunt Poſteri.</hi>

                     <p>ALL men being convinced that there is a God, from what they are, and from what is within their Souls and Bodies, as alſo from the Magnificent, Beautiful and Harmonious works of God, in the World round about them, and that he is moſt Powerful, Wiſe, Holy, Juſt and Gracious, &amp;c. It muſt neceſſarily follow, that this God ought to be worſhipped and ſerved,<note place="margin">Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> which is the Natural Religion due to God from all his Creatures, who do alſo expreſs it in one kind or other, but more eſpecially the Rational Creatures, who are moſt able and moſt obliged to give unto God this their reaſonable ſervice, and moſt eſpecially Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who have moſt need, and who ſtand in peculiar relation to God, who made them but a little lower than the Angels, and Lords of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour World, and deſigned them for the Inheritance of Glory with Angels and Arch-Angels in heaven.</p>
                     <p>To which Eſtate they ſhould have paſſed by Grace and Favour, if they had kept his Law which he firſt gave them; and then all their religious Applications to God ſhould have been, in the quality of Saints, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Praiſe, and Thankſgiving for evermore. But ſince the Firſt man did diſobey and die, all ſince do and ſuffer the ſame ſin and death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all their religious Addreſſes to God muſt be made in the quality of Sinners and Sufferers.</p>
                     <p>Being therefore thus ſinful and miſerable, in all their tranſactions from time to time with a Deity, they have been complaining and bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their condition, and imploring relief and mercy to cleanſe the ſtain of their Guilt, and to remove their ſorrow and plague, and after pardon to return praiſe and thanks. For this purpoſe, they all along poured out their Supplications, and offered their gifts and Sacrifices of their beſt things, even of their Children, ſometimes by a blind zeal thinking to pacifie and attone, if it might be, the wrath of a provoked God.</p>
                     <p>This way of Service in their approaches to Heaven, Nature prompted them unto, even to do the beſt they could to purifie themſelves and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe their Maker, Yet even this they quickly forgot, and performed the ſame Devotion to the Creatures that were below themſelves, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their Creatour out of an idle fancy that they could not ſee him, nor hear nor feel him, becauſe he was far above out of their ſight and reach. Therefore this Natural Information of Divine duty and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did not do the work, as is proved by the experience of Idolaters for ſome thouſands of years.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Supernatural Religion.</note>Therefore it was neceſſary that there ſhould be a ſupernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God to Man, for his conduct and guidance in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In order to which practice, and the end of Salvation whereto it was to tend, God that was in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, revealed his Will, what he would have done by Man, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, what was to be had of him for a Reward, by degrees more and more, till Chriſt came from the boſom of his Father, who brought in all Perfection, and taught us all things.

                     <p>FOr the better ſettlement of all Mediums for ever in the concerns of true Religion, God ſaw it moſt convenient, That all his Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by <hi>Moſes</hi> for that Diſpenſation Temporal, and by Chriſt for Reformation Eternal, ſhould both be aſſigned to Writing;<note place="margin">Writings.</note> becauſe written Laws and Teſtaments are far more evident and laſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Records, than verbal or tranſient oral Traditions can poſſibly be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

But by Writing, notwithſtanding Mortality, the Monuments and Records might be immortal.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe there will be a failure of unwritten Traditions and vocal Reports, by careleſsneſs and contradictions of Delivery and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, ſucceeding in the place of the ſimplicity and honeſty of firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Hence it came to paſs, that the old Ethnick Laws were loſt for want of writing, and ſuch as are preſerved are fabulous and ridiculous for want of wit and honeſty, and men are lapſed thereby into Polythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme and abſurd filthy ceremonies of Religion.</p>

Which was done accordingly, for matter of Fact, and God himſelf firſt began to do this thing, by writing his own Law with his own Finger, upon two Tables of Stone, and delivered them to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and commanded him to write other Statutes in a Book, to be laid up altogether in the Ark for Poſterity: Till he ſhould cancel that, and make another and better Law, which he did, and delivered it to Chriſt, who confirmed it by his Death, ſo as to continue for ever by way of Teſtament, which therefore was not of force till the death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and therefore ſhould never be diſanulled, becauſe,<note place="margin">Teſtamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Chriſt being dead from henceforth dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> And ſo we are given to underſtand, according to the manner of Men, That it can
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49664:32"/> no more be changed than a mans Teſtament, who being once dead and to live no more, it is impoſſible he ſhould alter his laſt Will, having no Will after his Death becauſe his Will died with him. And for the preſervation of this Teſtament, after it was delivered by Chriſt to his Apoſtles by word of mouth, They, by inſpiration from God, committed it to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Book of the New Teſtament, as now it is preſerved for us, and tranſmitted to us.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. A Teſtament barely nuncupative cannot be permanent.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe words ſpoken vaniſh into air, and may be miſ-heard, and miſ-underſtood, or forgotten.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Hearers and Witneſſes muſt die, and then all is loſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by hear-ſay from others who muſt die alſo, and ſo the farther the Teſtimony paſſes from one generation to another, the more it loſes or varies, till at laſt it dies and comes to nothing.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A Teſtament Written is moſt permanent.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe, <hi>Litera ſcripta manet;</hi> and though errours in ignorant Souls may be committed, yet the ſenſe and comparing of Copies will direct to Orthography.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Teſtatour dies, but his Will and Teſtament lives, and never lives till he dies and ever lives after his death, becauſe none can put his Will to death but he that made it, who is dead himſelf, and therefore can have no will or power to do it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, a Man may make Teſtaments and unmake them again as long as he liveth, as God did the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as men may do to their Laws and Statutes but when a man dies his laſt Teſtament ſtands, if there be a thouſand before it, they all fall and come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Publick Laws may be changed by new Law-makers, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on new occaſions, for a new People, and are ambulatory in every Age, yet the laſt Wills and Teſtaments of men, which are private Laws, can never be changed by their Heirs and Succeſſours, but muſt ſtand in force for ever, becauſe they are dead that made theſe Laws for their private Families, to tie up them and their Heirs for ever; For if it be but a mans Teſtament, no man diſannuls it.</p>
                     <p>For the faſtening therefore of the Goſpel for ever amongſt men, this is the way that God hath taken for men, after the manner of men, to ſettle his Commands, and to ſettle his Eſtate upon men. And all this is left written in a Book which is the Scriptures, which no other Book can rival in this pretence of a Divine Will.</p>

                           <hi>This I ſay, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of none effect.</hi> The Argument of the Apoſtle in the Paragraph, v. 15, 16, 17. is thus: Though it be but a Mans Covenant, yet if it be once confirmed, no ſuch Teſtatour can diſannul it, or ſuperadd thereunto by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49664:36"/> any after-Act, much leſs will the moſt holy and righteous God of heaven diſannul his own Teſtament when once it is confirmed. But I ſay, that Gods Teſtament was confirmed before the giving of the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Teſtament, could not diſannul or defeat the Promiſe therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined.</p>
                        <p>There are two Acts of a Teſtament.<note place="margin">Acts of a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Inſtitution or Faction, when a Teſtator declares this to be his laſt Will and Teſtament by Word, or Writing, or both.</p>
                        <p>Confirmation or Eſtabliſhing, when he ſilently declareth it to be unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and irrevocable, by dying or taking his death upon it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two are different Acts, done at different times, and by different means; the one in Life, the other in death.</p>
                        <p>Now the Old Teſtament of God for the Promiſory Part of it, was firſt inſtituted or ordained, when <hi>Abraham</hi> lived in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> before he dwelt in <hi>Charran,</hi> for there the Lord had ſaid unto him,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.2.</note> 
                           <hi>I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy Name great, and thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This Inſtitution was again declared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he lived at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> for there the Lord appeared unto him, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.4.</note> 
                           <hi>Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, Northward and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for all the Land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Sum of this Inſtitution was yet again renewed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he dwelt in the Plain of <hi>Mamre,</hi> which is <hi>Hebron,</hi> where the Lord ſaid unto him,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.7.</note> 
                           <hi>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this Land to inherit it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus Gods Ordination, Inſtitution or Faction of his Teſtament, was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared to <hi>Abraham;</hi> immediately after this laſt Intimation, the ſame Teſtament was confirmed by God.</p>
                        <p>For when <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired ſome farther Aſſurance, whereby he might know, that he ſhould inherit the Land promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon confirmed or eſtabliſhed his Teſtament by doing a ſolemn Act, which added ſuch Authority and force unto his Teſtament, that by vertue of that Act, God deprived himſelf (as a dead man) of all power of recalling it. Therefore by Gods appointment, certain Beaſts were ſlain and divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to half, and the pieces laid ſeverally one againſt another, and the Lord, as a Burning Lamp, paſſed between thoſe dead pieces, and by that paſſage his Teſtament was confirmed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. <hi>In that ſame day,</hi>

                           <hi>the Lord made a Covenant with Abraham:</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew, the Lord cut or diſpatched his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or Promiſe to Abraham;</hi> In the <hi>Greek, he diſpoſed his Diſpoſition to Abraham,</hi> i. e. he aſſured it to him, ſaying <hi>to thy Seed have I given this Land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>But a Covenant is not made by words of the Praeter-tenſe, as of things already done; and therefore the ſaying here imports not a Covenant but a Feoffment, a Deed of gift, or rather a Teſtament, which is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and ſtrongeſt Feoffment that can be made by God or Man, eſpecially when it conveyeth Land of Inheritance.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> though he doth call this Deed of God a Teſtament, yet he rather ſuppoſeth it to be a Covenant, becauſe the Beaſts were killed, as was the cuſtome in making Covenants.

                        <p>The reaſon why God confirmed his Teſtament, by his paſſage between the pieces of the dead Beaſts, is, becauſe this was an act of his <hi>Quaſi-dying:</hi> That God who is immortal and cannot die, did appoint thoſe Beaſts to be his Subſtitutes to die for him.<note place="margin">Gen. 15.9.</note> 
                           <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Take me an Heifer of three years old, i. e.</hi> Take for me, and for my uſe, and in my ſtead.

                        <p>And as the Promiſſory part, ſo by the ſame reaſon was the Mandatory part of Gods Teſtament dedicated or confirmed by Blood.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.18.</note> 
                           <hi>Neither was the firſt Teſtament dedicated without Blood; for when</hi> Moſes <hi>had ſpoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Precept to all the People, according to the Law he took the Blood of Calves and Goats, with Water, and Scarlet-wool and Hyſop, and ſprinkled both the Book and all the People, ſaying, This is the Blood of the Teſtament which God hath enjoyned unto you.</hi>

Secondly, that the People by their acceptance of Gods Law, and by their promiſe of Obedience thereunto, advanced Gods Law into a Covenant between God and them; for it was Gods will that the People ſhould obey his Law, and it was the Peoples will that they would obey. So there was an agreement of Wills between God and the People, and an agreement of Wills in ſeveral Parties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up the nature of a Covenant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Law was given to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> 430 years after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                           </note>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Law was given four hundred and thirty years after the Teſtament that was confirmed,</hi> the Particle <hi>After</hi> muſt not be referred to the word <hi>Confirmed,</hi> as if the Law had been inſtituted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49664:38"/> four hundred and thirty years after the Promiſe of the Teſtament was confirmed, for ſuch a ſenſe cannot be warranted from the Scripture, but the Particle <hi>After</hi> ought to be referred to the word <hi>Teſtament;</hi> for the meaning of the Apoſtle is this, That the Law was inſtituted four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after that the Promiſe was inſtituted, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſome few years after the Inſtitution of it was confirmed: For it is manifeſt, that there paſſed ſome years between the Inſtitution of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the Confirmation of it.</p>
                        <p>For the Promiſe was inſtituted before <hi>Abraham</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſojourn there, Gen. 12.1, &amp;c. And from the time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> firſt ſojourning in <hi>Egypt</hi> unto the time of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there paſſed juſt four hundred and thirty years to a day, Exod. 12.40. <hi>Now the ſojourning of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who dwelt in</hi> Egypt, (namely, from the firſt ſojourning of their Father <hi>Abraham) there paſſed four hundred and thirty years. And it came to paſs at the end of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years, even in the ſelf ſame day it came to paſs, that all the Hoſt of the Lord went out from the land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the Promiſes were inſtituted the ſame year wherein <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> went firſt to ſojourn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Law was inſtituted the ſame year wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then it muſt follow, that the Law was inſtituted four hundred and thirty years after the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Promiſe. By which account the Scriptures fully agree in the revolution of time, though the Chronologers agree not in ordering the computation, and in placing the period of it.</p>
                        <p>And this breeds not any defect or flaw in Gods Teſtament, that one part of it, namely the Mandatory, was made four hundred and thirty years after the other part, namely the Promiſſory; for if any ordinary man who hath and holdeth the faction of a Teſtament, may continue the making of his Teſtament all the time of his life, and to the Legacies and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof, may, when he pleaſeth, add what Conditions or Commands he will; much more may the Everlaſting God aſſume to himſelf a matter of four hundred and thirty years for the making and finiſhing of his Teſtament, ſeeing that a thouſand years are in his ſight but as yeſterday, and ſeeing that the Mandates or Commands of a Teſtament are no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal or neceſſary parts thereof, but only parts acceſſory, accidental and conditional; which may be inſerted at any time, or may be wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as in Abſolute Teſtaments) and yet the Teſtament ſhall be valid and good without them.</p>

                        <p>Gods Will is for the Penalties,<note place="margin">Penalty.</note> that the People ſhould endure them, in caſe they ſhould tranſgreſs the Precepts. To this Will of God the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple agree, and ſo the Penalties become a Covenant.</p>
                        <p>Gods Will is for the Promiſes, that the People ſhould enjoy them,<note place="margin">Promiſes.</note> in caſe they obſerve the Precepts. To this VVill of God the People agree by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Promiſes, and ſo the Promiſe becomes a Covenant: <hi>v.

                        <p>Some Covenants are Perſonal, and ſome paſs into Succeſſion, as this of Gods Covenanting in both his Teſtaments, to us and to our Seed, or rather to Chriſt and to his Seed.</p>
                        <p>It is a great grace and favour to make a Teſtament,<note place="margin">Free Grace.</note> and therein a bequeſt of temporal and eternal Inheritances, to ſuch as had no hopes, nor uſed any means by themſelves or others for the procuring of the ſaid grace, which therefore was abſolutely free. But beſides this original Grace, here is a farther condeſcenſion in God that gives it, to make a Covenant with them to whom he gives it. So God Covenants with his Creatures as a King with his Subjects, and a Father with his Children, or a Lord with his Vaſſals, to do them good.</p>
                        <p>Thus God is every way good and gracious in both his Teſtaments and Covenants, as a Teſtatour and Donor in his Promiſes, and as an Ally and Confederate in his Propoſitions and Conditions.</p>
                        <p>From both which Promiſes and Commands of God, giving to,<note place="margin">All Hope from Gods Covenant.</note> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with Mankind, Mankind doth derive all their Comforts and Aſſurances, eſpecially for eternal bleſſedneſs. And without theſe, by their Creation or otherwiſe, they could have no right, title, nor claim to the Inheritance of eternal life, which only comes by promiſe and gift, upon condition or covenant.</p>
                        <p>Thus God is and muſt be our God by Creation whether we will or no,<note place="margin">God our God by Covenant.</note> but he cannot be our God by grace and favour without our conſent to his Covenant.</p>
                        <p>This lifts the Creature up to nearer Relation to its Creatour for life eternal, which nature could not do;<note place="margin">Covenant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the Creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Nature.</note> becauſe a Creature is of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frail and finite, therefore cannot be eternal, which is impregnable and infinite: and alſo, becauſe let the Creature ſerve God all it can, it cannot merit eternal life, becauſe it is Gods Creature and owns a duty to its Creatour, and does no more than it ought to do.</p>
                        <p>But when Grace comes and proffers Bleſſedneſs, to which the Party to whom it is proffered, Mankind, may have a right, if they will accept of the Promiſe, and keep that Right ſo had and obtained, by obeying the Covenant, or Condition, or Command annexed to the Promiſe: Then is the poor Creature nearly allyed to his God, as his Son by Adoption, and Heir alſo of the gift of the Inheritance, and as his Friend in intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and ſociety with him, by Covenant or Agreement of will to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of what he hath given him, and do what he hath commanded him.</p>

                        <p>We are Gods Propriety already paſſively, but being reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures, we may by act of our own, from Gods grace ſo enabling us, give our ſelves to God again for his propriety. As he hath given us to our ſelves,<note place="margin">To give ones ſelf to God.</note> and for his own; ſo we give our ſelves again to him to be his own, by our own conſents. A Captive is his who hath redeemed him, whether he will or no, but if he give himſelf freely to him, this is a more ſpecial intereſt between both Parties, and proceeds from the love of the Redeemed to him that did redeem him, who therefore firſt loved him, that he might love him again, and be in League with him as his Friend as well as Servant, yea, as his Son and Heir. To give all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of our ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> of our Souls and Bodies, for the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruct and ſervice of God: To give all our Honours and Eſtates for Gods glory.</p>
                        <p>This muſt of neceſſity follow from a deed or gift of Propriety, to him with whom we are alſo in League, that this Gift of our ſelves ſhould be for the uſe and behoof of him to whom we give our ſelves, and all that we are or have, or ſhall have. As Slaves that are bought with mony, are their Lords goods for Propriety and Dominion, ſo alſo for Intereſt and Profit, their wit, their ſtrength and labour, and all the products and iſſues of them all, internal or external, accrue to their Lord; that is, their Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities, plots and contrivances, their Off-ſpring of their Bodies, the works of their hands, they being not their own themſelves, all that they have, contrive, or do acquire, by moſt juſt right is claimed by their Lord and Owner. They were Lords of their own wills before, and free in Soul though not in Body. But if they ſhall farther ſurrender up as they have, their Perſons, by act of their own, ſo alſo their Wits and Wills, and all their ſtrengths to their Lord and Maſter, who was ſo before, and make him their Lord and Maſter again by their own Love, yea, even their King and Father; this creates a ſpecial Right, more excellent than the former to all intents and purpoſes, of love, and kindneſs, and profit too, to the Inferiour eſpecially, who is the Beneficiary, the Superiour being the Benefactour and Patron.</p>

                        <p>Thus by Covenant we give our Perſons, our Wits, our Children, or Labours and Poſſeſſions unto God, who hath ſo graciouſly given himſelf alſo for our Propriety to be our God, beſides his Creation, by an act of Grace of his own ſuperadded, as alſo to our uſufruct in all his actings and operations, and alſo in all his eſtate and bleſſedneſs. All which are Himſelf, made ours, altogether to our benefit, and nothing at all accrues from us to his advantage, as is uſual to Temporal Lords, Friends and Allies.</p>
                        <p>This it is to be in Covenant with God, when God gives himſelf to us, and we give our ſelves again unto God: And this is the nature of true and ſaving Faith, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Contrary unto this is our Covenanting with the Devil, and the World,<note place="margin">To give our Souls to the Devil.</note> and the Fleſh, in giving away our Souls and Bodies for propriety, and our Faculties and Eſtates for uſufruct, to theſe Enemies of God and our ſelves to our deſtruction; and this is Infidelity and renouncing all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Communion with God.</p>
                        <p>So I give me and mine to God, and God receives what I give, and I am his.</p>

                        <p>And ſo alſo the ſecond Covenant of the New Teſtament was hinted from the Creation, in the revelation, in part, of a Spiritual Law,<note place="margin">Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the Creation.</note> to thoſe that did obey the Law of Nature; and in the obſcure revelation of ſpiritual and eternal Promiſes, to thoſe that embraced the carnal and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ones.</p>
                        <p>But ſtill, there was no Law written in Tables till <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſtill, there was no full Revelation of the ſpiritual Law, and of ſpiritual and eternal Promiſes, till Chriſt came and wrote them perfectly by his Spirit in the heart.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Law written.</note>Therefore when the writing of the Law of Nature upon the heart was almoſt quite worn out, by habits and practices of unnatural Evils, and the univerſal Examples of Wicked men, turning from God to Idols, and walking after the imaginations of their own hearts continually; God made a Covenant with the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Carnal duties, and fruition of Carnal rewards, to lead them on farther, and prepare them to the practice of ſpiritual Services, and enjoyment of eternal Rewards, which to them, as to Children, were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and ſhadowed out, by ſeveral Rites and Ceremonies, and temporal Proſperities.</p>
                        <p>Theſe leſſer and weaker Commands and Promiſes God gave unto them for that time of their Minority, and reſerved the manifeſtation of his higher and ſtronger Commands and Promiſes till the fullneſs of time, when all things ſhould be made perfect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Spirit more plentiful in the Goſpel.</note>Therefore God ſprinckled a leſſer portion of his Spirit upon ſome before and under the Law, according to their preſent capacities.

                        <q>Tantae molis erat Divinam condere Gentem.</q>
                        <p>Thus, by degrees, Mankind arrived to the higheſt Revelations and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Gods love by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Chriſt.</note>Therefore God, from all Eternity, intended and predeſtinated the Promiſes of his laſt Will and Covenant of Grace, to be confirmed and executed by his Son Jeſus Chriſt in the fullneſs of time, which he had appointed; by virtue whereof, all that feared, or do fear, or ſhall fear God, ſhall be rewarded of God in and through Chriſt, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World unto the end thereof, under all the former inferiour and imperfect adumbrations and Diſpenſations, and under the preſent ſublime and perfect ſubſtance and Oeconomy of the Goſpel. And ſo this everlaſting, great and true Covenant of Grace, expreſſed in Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, revealed by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, hath, and doth, and ſhall take full force and effect to all intents and purpoſes, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively to every faithful Soul all the World over, for Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are able to receive it, according to the meaſure of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his mercy at all times: God ſtill accounting the will for the deed, after the riches of his Grace, according to what a man hath, not according to what a man hath not, and rejecting none that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as well as they are able, making them more able. <hi>For in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>

                        <p>Thus it is demonſtrated, that there are two eminent diſtinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants or Teſtaments, the one of the Law, and the other of the Goſpel.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49664:42"/> The Law is one Husband, the Goſpel another: The Law is a School-maſter of Rudiments and Elements, the Goſpel a Doctour of Sciences and Perfections. Repentance is not fully in the Law but in the Goſpel, yet often inculcated by the Prophets.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and the Patriarchs, had no better things promiſed expreſsly than Earth, yet by faith they looked for better things, which God by his Spirit, though not in words had revealed, yet obſcurely and afar off.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſtiled in Scripture the firſt Covenant, the Goſpel given by Chriſt is ſtiled the ſecond Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thus it appears,<note place="margin">Corollaries.</note> That God gave a particular Command to <hi>Adam</hi> to try his obedience, upon a promiſe of Life.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> and a promiſe of Chriſt; ſo to the Patriarchs, ſo to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo the Inheritance came by Promiſe, not by Works.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That God made a Covenant of Works to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, called the firſt Teſtament, formally made.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That the Promiſe of Chriſt was made to <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and the Fathers, but it was not framed into a Teſtament till Chriſts death.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That the Law of Nature was made to <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity, but it was not made into a Teſtament till <hi>Moſes</hi> confirmed it by the blood of Beaſts.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That thus the Law of Grace was to the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity, but it was not made into a Teſtament till Chriſt confirmed it by his own blood.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That many Covenants there were then of God, but no Teſtaments ſave only the Old and the New.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That before the Law the Promiſes of the Goſpel were in part darkly revealed, but never clearly and fully till Chriſt came.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. That the Precepts of the Old Teſtament were in expreſs words but for external obedience in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, but the Prophets hinted out Internal obedience.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. That the Promiſes of the Old Teſtament were in expreſs words but for Temporal bleſſings, in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, but the Prophets hinted out Eternal Bleſſings.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. That both Precepts and Promiſes were ſpiritual and eternal by Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. That that which the Scripture calls the Covenant of Works is <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. That that which the Scripture calls the Covenant of Grace is Chriſts Law.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. That every Covenant is by Faith, and mutual Promiſes of both Parties, for Works to be done and Rewards to be had.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. That the Covenant of the Goſpel is meer Faith, in God promiſing and Man accepting, and Re-promiſing, not for Works to obtain Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but for Faith alone.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. That Faith is not a credence or belief of ſtory or truſt, but a Promiſe, Covenant, Affiance and Alliance. He is a faithful Subject, not that believes the Commands of his Prince to be true, but that keeps his faith and Allegiance with his Prince.</p>
                        <p n="17">
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49664:43"/>17. That there is a Reformation, there is Shadow and Subſtance, there are two Mediators, two Laws, two Prieſthoods, and two Services. Two Temples, two Altars, two Sacrifices, two Tabernacles. An Expiation of Carnal and Spiritual Sins, a Purification of Body and Soul, a Carnal and a Spiritual Worſhip. A general Correction and Amendment of all things in the moſt excellent State and Condition that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. That the Firſt Tabernacle is fallen, the old Prieſthood turned from the Altar; And into the Second and True Tabernacle of Heaven Chriſt the great High-Prieſt is entred.</p>
                        <p n="19">19.

                        <p n="20">20. That the firſt Teſtament for the Precepts made to <hi>Moſes</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Death of Beaſts, for the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in the Letter, but myſtically and eminently for Heaven in the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. That the Second Teſtament for the Promiſes and Precepts made to Chriſt, was confirmed by the Death of Chriſt for Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. That the Goſpel was not contained and comprehended in the Law, as blended both together in one, but is a diſtinct Thing from the Law, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting by its ſelf, as Carnal and Spiritual, Temporal and Eternal, Life and Death, Heaven and Earth are diſtinct Things.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. That the Law of Nature was before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, not loaded with ſo many Poſitive Precepts, but that they were brought in afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> God then inſtructing them by a more familiar Converſation, as occaſion did offer.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. That Judaiſm is younger, and different from Chriſtianity, <hi>Moſes</hi> from Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. That Salvation was by Chriſt, who was to come before and under the Law, and by Chriſt already come under the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. That by the Publiſhing of the Goſpel, the original Law of God is not abrogated, continuing ſtill the Rule of all mens Actions; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthned, and enlarged to all thoſe Precepts, which are Poſitively commanded by Chriſt under the Goſpel, as the Perfection of the Law of Nature, generally propounded to all mankind for Salvation, and are therefore ſtiled a New Law Eternal,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> whereas the Old Law was to hold but till the time of Reformation.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. That this Diſpenſation, by which the Fathers obtained Salvation before the Goſpel, was granted to them in conſideration of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which our Lord Chriſt had taken upon him to perform in the fulneſs of Time, by a kind of Novation, as the Civilians ſpeak, or Delegation, or Renewing of Bonds, or Aſſignation of Payments.

                        <p n="28">28. That this the New Teſtament doth manifeſt, for the reaſon of the Salvation of thoſe that died under the Old Teſtament.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, that our Fathers were all under the cloud, and all paſſed through the Sea, and all were baptized into</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eat the ſame Spiritual meat and all drank the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drink, for they all drank of the ſame Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="29">
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49664:43"/>29. That they therefore that entred into a Covenant of Works to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lord of Promiſe as they did, cannot be ſaid to have entred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly into a Covenant of Faith in Chriſt for obtaining the World to come: No more than being baptized into <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Cloud and in the Sea, as they were (that is into his Government, into the obſervation of the Laws he ſhould give, in hope of the Promiſes he ſhould give) they can be ſaid to have been baptized expreſsly into Chriſt, and that profeſſion which his Promiſes require.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore when he ſaith that the Rock was Chriſt, his meaning is not immediately Chriſt, and ſo to thoſe that reſted wholly in that Temporal Covenant of Works: But as the Manna was Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was Chriſt, by the means of that Faith which then God received at their hands, to wit, the Aſſurance of everlaſting happineſs, for them, who under this Calling, ſhould as they were able, ſincerely tender unto God, the Spiritual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Inward man, not expreſſed but implied (as well as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obedience of the outward man expreſſed) upon thoſe grounds which his Temporal goodneſs, the Tradition of their Fathers, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Prophets afforded at that time. Now I appeal to the ſenſe of all Diſcerning men, how they can be ſaid to have that Intereſt in Chriſt, which Chriſtians have (and therefore upon the ſame ground) if there were no conſideration of Chriſt, in the bleſſings of Chriſt which they enjoyed. Wherefore they are ſaid alſo to tempt Chriſt, who went along with them, in that Angel, in whom the Name of God and his Word was, for the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and for Heaven too, though they knew not that Chriſt, nor Heaven diſtinctly.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.26. Heb. 13.8.</note> So <hi>Moſes counted the Reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>for he looked at the Recompence of the Reward. For Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday and to day and for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that the Prophets who foretold the Goſpel <hi>ſearched dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, againſt what time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them,</hi>

                           <hi>declared and teſtified before hand, the ſufferings of Chriſt and the glorious things that followed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that <hi>all Gods Promiſes are Yea and Amen in Chriſt.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be a Conſideration of Chriſt in thoſe Promiſes, though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly, to them who under ſuch Promiſes as they had, did run the ſame Race which Chriſtians have ſet before them.</p>
                        <p>And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>As by Adam all die,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 5.12.19.</note> 
                           <hi>even ſo in Chriſt (the ſecond Adam) ſhall all be made alive. And by one man Sin entred into the World, and ſo death paſsed upon all men, for that all have ſinned. And if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many, For as by one Mans Diſobedience many were made Sinners: So by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one ſhall many be made Righteous.</hi> It is evident that thoſe and all other Benefits not only to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but to all that feared God and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him, did redound to them upon the conſideration and account of Chriſt. For there is no other name under Heaven given unto men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can be ſaved but only by the Name of Chriſt. And God is the great Benefactor and exceeding great Rewarder only in and for Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Chriſt is the Mediator of the New Covenant, That, Death coming,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note> 
                           <hi>for the ranſome of thoſe Tranſgreſſions which were under the old, they that are called may receive the Promiſe of an everlaſting inheritance.</hi> Becauſe thoſe Sins which were redeemed only to a temporal effect, by the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Old Law, as alſo thoſe which were not redeemed at all by any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49664:44"/> Propitiation then, were all by the Sacrifice of Chriſt redeemed to the purchaſe of the World to come. Which is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that through Chriſt, <hi>every one that believeth is juſtified from all thoſe ſins from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes.<note place="margin">Act. 13.29.</note> For as the Law did not expiate Capital Offences, ſo it expiated none, but to the Effect of a Civil Promiſe.</p>
                        <p n="30">
                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.8.</note>30. That whereas mention is made of Names not written in the Book of Life, of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world. We may not inferr ſafely that the Lamb was ſlain from the foundation of the world, but was predeſtinated to be ſlain, and his Death was virtual to all the faithful ever ſince the foundation of the world, whoſe names were written, under that Appellative in that book of Life of the Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19, 20.</note> 
                           <hi>Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> demands to be blotted out of Gods Book, what can it be but the book of Chriſt in a Myſtical ſenſe? And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for all,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6.</note> 
                           <hi>to be teſtified in due time,</hi> what can be meant, but that though he gave himſelf for all, yet this was not to be teſtified till the proper time of the preaching of the Goſpel? yet he was a Ranſom for all before.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> argues ſtrongly, That <hi>if Chriſt ſhould offer himſelf more than once,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 9.25, 26.</note> 
                           <hi>that then he might more than once have entred into the Holy of Holies, and ſo muſt have ſuffered more than once from the foundation of the World,</hi> that is, before the end of the World, he muſt needs ſuppoſe that he offered for all, and ſuffered for all that were ſaved before the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. That by all this I do not affirm, that all that were ſaved under the Law, though in conſideration of Chriſt, did underſtand in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration Chriſt ſhould be their ſalvation, as Chriſtians under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel do; but that they underſtood it darkly in their Elders and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the Prophets of God and their Diſciples, the Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who were alſo Prophets) and the Fathers of ſeveral Ages, of whom we read <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. who being acquainted with the ſecret of Gods purpoſe, were to acquaint the People with it, ſo ſparingly, and by ſuch degrees as the ſecret wiſdom of God had appointed.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. That theſe things being thus premiſed, I acknowledge the Act of God in diſpenſing in the execution of his original Law, and bringing the grace of the Goſpel into effect inſtead of it, not to be the act of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon, remitting this private Intereſt in the puniſhment of thoſe ſins whereby his Law was tranſgreſſed; but the act of a Maſter of a Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, or the Prince and Soveraign of a Common-wealth, diſpoſing of Mankind as his Subjects or houſhold Servants. But the ſufferings of Chriſt were accepted of God, to give him that Satisfaction as might move him in conſideration thereof, abating that debt of Puniſhment which we are engaged to, by tranſgreſſing his Original Law, to publiſh an act of Grace, admitting all to remiſſion of ſins and right to everlaſting life, that will undertake to be true Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. That ſtill along in my conceptions upon this point, I meet with the exact diſtinction between the two Covenants and Diſpenſations of God by the mediation of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of Chriſt.

                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 1.5.</note> 
                           <hi>and to paſs through the Sea, and to be baptized into</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, and did all eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drank the ſame ſpiritual drink, for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them, which Rock was Chriſt.</hi> All this while they had not a drop of water to wet them, but the Waters were a wall unto them on both ſides till they paſſed through the Red-Sea on dry ground, being protected with a Cloud to cover their heads, and their Enemies ſank like Lead in the mighty Waters.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. That this therefore was the beginning of that Peoples engagement unto God, which though ſhortly after they departed from at <hi>Marah,</hi> yet being reconciled to God by his patience and goodneſs, in fulfilling their deſires beyond their deſerts, they reingaged themſelves to God to obey him and keep the Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>Ex.</hi> 16.27, 28, 29. until being come to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they received the Decalogue, and afterwards the whole Law. So we being redeemed from the <hi>Egypt</hi> of this World, undertake to leave it under the conduct of Chriſt, and hereupon our ſins are drowned in the myſtical Waters of Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. That this argues a correſpondency and reſemblance, but no Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and ſameneſs, between the two Teſtaments.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. That therefore I cannot but admire (but the ſtream carries them, which is ſtrong too) that Wiſe men, and learned in the Scriptures, ſhould maintain that as the Teſtaments, ſo the Sacraments are the ſame. If ſo, then the Kingdom of Heaven and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> are both one thing, then Baptiſme and the paſſage through the Red-Sea are all one; then the Paſseover and the Lords-Supper are all one; then to believe in <hi>Moſes</hi> for his conduct to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to believe in Chriſt for his conduct to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, are all one. But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye believe in</hi> Moſes, <hi>believe alſo in me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="37">37. That if ſetting aſide the correſpondence, they make the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God under <hi>Moſes</hi> for the obtaining the Land of Promiſe one thing, and our engagement to God under Chriſt for the obtaining of Heaven another, certainly, the immediate aſſurance of this, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate aſſurance of that, are ſeveral things: And if there be between the Old and New Covenant that correſpondence which makes one the figure of the other, they may as well be ſaid to be one and the ſame, as my Picture is the ſame with me, becauſe it is called by my name, which cannot be. But to ſay that the Sacraments of the Old Law do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately figure or aſſure the ſame thing which the Sacraments of the Goſpel do, is the ſame thing as to ſay, the Reſt of the Land of Promiſe, and the everlaſting Reſt of the kingdom of Heaven, are both one and the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="38">38. That upon this ground St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues concerning the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Deut. 30.12.14.</note> from the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the Law. <hi>The Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſaith thus, Say not in thine heart, Who will aſcend into Heaven,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 10.10.</note> to wit, <hi>to bring down Chriſt? Or, who will go down into the Deep,</hi> to wit, <hi>to bring up Chriſt from the dead? But what ſaith it? the word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is, the word of Faith which we preach, That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe with thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart a man believes to Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made to Salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Argument is this, That if <hi>Moſes</hi> duly warned the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49664:45"/> they have no excuſe for not obeying the Law, which he had put as it were in their mouths and into their hearts, by his ſo frequent and plain teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, by Precept upon Precept, here a little and there a little, frequently repeated; then if Chriſt as duly warn the Chriſtians, they can have no excuſe for not obeying the Goſpel, which he had put as it were in their mouths and into their hearts, by the Apoſtles preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. If therefore the profeſſion of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by Circumciſion ties him to the Law, ſhall not the profeſſion of a Chriſtian, who is the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by Baptiſme and the Circumciſion of the Spirit, tye him to the Goſpel? Do therefore the names of a <hi>New Covenant</hi> or a <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſignifie no difference between them, or ſo little that they are one and the ſame in effect, and that the one is comprehended in the other? Conſider well what hath been ſaid, and will be ſaid to the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. That as to the Common ſalvation both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> with and without a Law, once more give me leave to ſhew, that while they were under this diſpenſation, there was another traffick driving under hand, in dark and obſcure terms between God and them for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World to come, to his Law written or unwritten, for ſuch reaſons, and to ſuch an end, and with ſuch meaſures as he requireth, for cauſes beſt known to himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="40">40. That therefore the Law is ſpiritual, <hi>Ro.</hi> 7.14. and a Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>of his fullneſs we have all received, and grace for grace; for the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> the Grace of the Goſpel inſtead of the grace of the Law.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.13.</note> 
                           <hi>The Goſpel is in words not taught by mans wiſdom, but by the Holy Ghoſt, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual,</hi> i. e. the Spiritual things of the Goſpel as ſignified by the Law, to the ſame ſpiritual things as revealed by Chriſt. So, <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God</hi> (in the Goſpel) <hi>from faith to faith,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> 
                           <hi>i. e.</hi> from the faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to the faith under the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>Moſt true it is, as hath been obſerved, that this Spirit of the Law was not diſcovered in the Law, but by revelation of Gods Spirit that made it, and that chiefly to Princes and Prophets, the Prieſts had little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg beſides the Letter. The Prophets therefore called up the People higher than the Carnal Ordinance, to the ſpiritual Service of Law. <hi>Noah</hi> is called <hi>the Preacher of Righteouſneſs</hi> (not of the Law of Rites which then was not) and they that reſiſted are charged for reſiſting the Spirit of God that called them to it.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Stephen</hi> taxeth the <hi>Jews</hi> all along for reſiſting Gods Spirit under the adminiſtration of the Law, and now for reſiſting Chriſt himſelf. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not underſtand the power of Gods Spirit in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> by that act of killing the <hi>Egyptian</hi> that did the wrong, and offering to make peace between the two <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that he was ſent to be a Judge among them, And as the People were rebellious to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo they were to the Great Prophet whom <hi>Moſes</hi> had foretold; he concludes thus, <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in hearts and ears, ye do alwaies reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>as your Fathers, ſo you alſo. Which of the Prophets did not your Fathers perſecute? killing thoſe that foretold of the coming of that Righteous One, of whom you are now become the Traitours and Murtherers?</hi> And all that we read in the Old Teſtament of the grace of God to that People, and of their ungraciouſneſs to him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting his grace, tends to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="41">
                           <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49664:45"/>41. That it is truly ſaid indeed, In rendring two kinds of Reaſon (the true Reaſon being unknown) why Chriſt came not till towards the latter end of the World: That God meant firſt to ſhew the World, that other means which he thought fit to uſe, to reclaim the World by the Fathers, and by the Law, and by his Judgments and Favours were not efficacious, that the neceſſity of Chriſts coming might appear.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. That this is not to be underſtood as if God meant to render them inexcuſable, by uſing inſufficient means that could not take effect: But that diſpenſing to thoſe times ſuch means of Grace as the reaſons of his ſecret Counſels did require, proportionable to the obedience and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he expected at their hands; he reſerves the full meaſure of them to the coming of his Son, proportionable to the difficulty of bearing the Croſs, which he purpoſed for the condition of thoſe Promiſes which he brought.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame is to be ſaid of the Fathers under the Law of Nature, who by walking by that Rule did pleaſe God, and were advanced farther by his Spirit to nearer Communion with him; as appears in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> preſenting large Inſtances both of Gods correſpondence with the godly of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of the Piety of their converſation with him.</p>
                        <p>And if God gave his Creatures ſo much underſtanding and liberty as he was pleaſed to allow, and as he knew to be ſufficient for them, if they ſhall put forth theſe their abilities to the utmoſt of the power that God hath given them, ſhall that which he gave for ſufficient, when uſed, be counted inſufficient, and they be condemned for doing according as God did enable them? Or, ſhall he give them no means at all ſufficient, and reject them for the inſufficiency which he ſet them in? or, will God require more than he gives? and be ſo hard a man as to reap where he did not ſow, and gather where he had not ſtrawed? and require Bricks without Straw? Theſe are hard thoughts! far be it from us to ſpeak or think after this faſhion, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the World do right?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="43">43. That it cannot be ſuppoſed that God ſhould employ his Creatures in his ſervice, and not reward them for it; much leſs that he ſhould cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them with a decree that they ſhould never have power to ſerve him, and be condemned for it.</p>
                        <p n="44">44. That we may not ſafely think, that becauſe Chriſt came late into the World, therefore the benefit of his coming was the leſs, and that all or moſt of the Nations beſides the <hi>Jews,</hi> or moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> did periſh for want of Chriſt. No by no means, Chriſt is the ſame to day, yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and for ever, and the merit of his Mediation extends to all, before, at, and after his coming in the fleſh, unto the Worlds end.</p>
                        <p n="45">45. That to cloſe up this long Title, I conclude with ſubmiſſion, not magiſterially, That ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt hath diſtinguiſhed between the Law and the Goſpel, none ought to preſume to mingle them together as one and the ſame in their Nature, or as one and the ſame in effect and operation, or that one is contained in the other, the New Teſtament in the Old.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. That to let paſs therefore the oratorical and hyperbolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Fathers, in this and other points, who were moſt of them bred in the Schools of Rhetoricians, as alſo the School Terms, and other ſtrained expreſſions of Modern Syſtematicks, let us chooſe rather to adhere to the form of ſound words delivered in the Scriptures,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49664:46"/> which are the Pandects or body of Divinity that we muſt truſt unto; and for explication of our conceptions upon them, make uſe of thoſe Jural words that are moſt homogeneal unto them. And to be ſure this is the ſafeſt way, becauſe all Heterogeneous and Exotick terms muſt needs puzzle the underſtanding, more than ſuch as are genuine and nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Subject. Theſe are connatural, and familiar and obvious, the other remote, difficult and forced. Take this Cauſe and hold it, and it may bid fair for the Peace of Chriſtendom. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus Man at firſt did not like to keep Covenant with God. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had a deſire to be greater than God thought fit to make them, and would fain have been as Gods to themſelves, without ſuch dependance of God as was by a Covenant to do Gods will, for they had a mind to do only their own will, and to know Good and Evil, and to be Immortal; for ſo was God, and ſo would they have been.</p>
                        <p>When therefore out of an aſpiring mind they had taſted of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, in hopes to be made wiſer, they would have gone farther to the Tree of Life, in hopes to be made immortal too if God had not ſtopped them,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.21.</note> ſaying, <hi>Behold the Man is become like one of us knowing good and evil; and now leſt he put forth his hand, and take alſo of the Tree of Life and live for ever—.

                        <p>Men have not all wit in themſelves, ſome body muſt be wiſer than they, that is, able to dictate unto them what they ſhould underſtand and do: And that which is wiſer than we is a God to us, and God is wiſer than us all, and is a God to us all.</p>
                        <p>Men have not all Power in themſelves, ſome body muſt be ſtronger than they, that is, able to rule them; and that which is ſtronger than us all is a God to us all. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> loſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and could not ſee God, and they lacked ſuch gods as they could ſee, ſaying, <hi>Make us Gods to go before us.</hi> And when they were made, they rejoyced for thoſe dumb and blind Leaders, the Golden Calves, ſaying, <hi>Theſe be thy Gods, O Iſrael.</hi> Gods they lacked mightily, and theſe were the beſt they could chooſe, ſuch as they had ſeen in <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Natural to have a God.</note>It is natural to look out for Gods, therefore all the World have deſired Kings, or others of different Titles who had the ſame power, to counſel them, and rule them, and defend them.

                        <p>The Heathens in all their Ignorances and Dangers, fled to their Gods and God-like men to inſtruct them and fight for them.

                        </p>
                        <p>Knowing therefore that God is, and muſt be our God by Right of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether we will or no, why ſhould we fly to them that are no Gods? And be in Covenant with them? When God calls upon us every way, but eſpecially in his Goſpel to be his People, and promiſes to be our God, as by Nature, ſo by Grace, if we will take him to be our God, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with him.</p>
                        <p>A great Grace for God thus to offer himſelf, and promiſe his Grace, if we will accept it; he firſt loveth us, that we might love him, becauſe he loved us.</p>
                        <p>Therefore how ingracious a thing muſt it be for a Creature, beloved of God, to refuſe the offer of his Grace, who is the Creator, and will be their Redeemer and Saviour, if they will but chuſe him for their God, and keep his Covenant? What more can be done by God or Man in this Caſe? And how can a Covenant be made without the Conſent of both Parties? Salvation it ſelf cannot ſave thoſe men, that thus reject the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God againſt themſelves: No man can receive a Grace from God or man, without or againſt his Will: Salvation it ſelf is not able to ſave
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49664:47"/> thoſe that will not be ſaved; God nor man can do any good unto a wilful Soul. If we periſh, we periſh and deſtroy our ſelves, But in God is our help, if we will take it.</p>
                        <p>It is natural reaſon, that teacheth us to be in Covenant with God.<note place="margin">Natural to be in Covenant with God.</note> If he made us and not we our ſelves, if he preſerve us, and not we our ſelves, then he is to give us Laws and not we our ſelves; and we are to obey his Laws, and not our own Luſts: It is a perfect Covenant that we are bound to make with God: Who ſaith <hi>do ut des, facio ut facies,</hi> I give you your Being and Preſervation therein, that you ſhould give me your Obedience and Subjection, I do this for you, that you may do ſomething for me, even what I ſhall command you.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>To be in Covenant with God is to keep his Laws, and they are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but his yoke is eaſy and his burden is light: And it is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do what God requireth by the help of his Grace: And he is Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true, that will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but will together with the Temptation give ſtrength, that we may be able to bear it.</p>
                        <p>The Law is a Contract or Covenant, becauſe he that cometh under a Law, hath bound himſelf to keep it, as the Law-maker himſelf hath done. All other Creatures, without Life, Reaſon, or Will, obey their Creator. The Sun knoweth his ſetting, and the Moon her Seaſons, and all the Stars ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Motions, by a Quaſi-Covenant; but reaſonable Creatures do perfectly oblige themſelves by their free Conſent and Agreement with God their Lord, beſides their natural Obligation, common to them with all other Creators.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to conclude, the Benefit of our covenanting with God, is, that thereby we have Right to all that we have, or can have, in order to our Bleſſedneſs, and without it we have right to nothing but Curſedneſs. There muſt always be means for the obtaining of the end which we aim at, when the Will by it's own Motion cannot immediately effect, that the End ſhould approach to the Agent, or the Agent to the end: This Rule therefore muſt be obſerved, <hi>Qui jus dat ad finem, cenſetur etiam jus dare ad illa me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, ſine quibus finis obtineri nequit, aliàs enim nihil eſſet actum.</hi> He that gives Right to the end, doth give Right to thoſe means, without which that end cannot be obtained, or elſe nothing is done. From whence it follows, that if theſe means be unlawful or impoſſible, I am not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to that end, ſo far forth as it is attainable only by uſing ſuch means. Thence it is, that evil is not to be done that good may come thereof. No man can be bound to do that good, to which without ſin he cannot arrive: So that he may come off from ſuch unlawful Vows. But when a man is bound to good Means for a good End, he cannot come off ſafely, but if he do, the Covenant is broken and the other Party free, as both may be if they ſo agree.</p>

                        <p>The Matrimonial Covenant, by the divine Poſitive Law hath this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Prerogative, That the eſſence of the Conjugal vow not being viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it cannot be diſſolved, though by conſent of both Parties, as other temporary Covenants are.</p>
                        <p>It is commonly denyed that any man can be obliged to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the ſame Perſon is the Obliger and the Obliged, the obliger may free the obliged when he pleaſeth, and he that can do this is actually free: And ſo a Prince cannot be obliged to his Subjects, becauſe they have reſigned up their wills to his will, abſolutely, without reſerving any power to themſelves. According to that common Rule of Law, That in Covenants there muſt be two Parties; and when the Debtour ſucceeds the Creditour, the debt ceaſeth, or the obligation is taken away by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, when of two perſons one is made.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are Subtleties, and true as to matter of outward action of Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law, that cannot be intended by a man againſt himſelf, or a Subject againſt his Prince <hi>in foro humano:</hi> But nevertheleſs in plain truth and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a man may be bound firmly to himſelf, and a Prince to his Subjects by the Law of Nature, and the action hold good <hi>in foro divino;</hi> and God may require the obligation of his Creature, and puniſh the neglect: Becauſe a Man by promiſing to take care of himſelf, in tying up himſelf to any good, is obliged to do it, as he is the Servant of God and a Member of humane Society, and be puniſhable by God and Men for not doing it. As that Servant that ſhall diſable himſelf from doing his Lords ſervice, or that Member of a Society that hath lamed himſelf, or otherwiſe, from doing his Country ſervice is juſtly puniſhable by them both: As was the Souldier that cut off his finger becauſe he would ſerve no longer in War, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But to wave all niceties, ſtill this is evident and plain, That in all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants to make them perfect, there is required the Will of the Promiſee, and the Will of him to whom the Promiſe is made, for where this is wanting, and that this Party refuſeth to accept of the thing promiſed, though the other Party hath confirmed his Promiſe by an Oath, yet the right of the thing ſo promiſed and ſworn, remains entirely with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer, becauſe no man can be willing to obtrude his own Goods upon a Perſon that is unwilling to receive them; it being alwaies a condition neceſſarily ſuppoſed, That any man gives a thing no otherwiſe than if the Party for whom he intends it ſhall accept thereof: Neither can any man be imagined ſo void of reaſon, as ſimply to renounce his own Right, and to leave thoſe things <hi>pro derelictis,</hi> at random for any body, which he hath laid at the foot of the Refuſer, but they are his ſtill as fully as ever.</p>

                        <p>From this general and perpetual Law of Nature to all Mankind flow thoſe particular Laws to ſome Nations, but to all in thoſe Nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be perpetual, but as emergencies may fall out changeable; but ſtill, thoſe Laws that ſucceed muſt be as the former, agreeable to the univerſal Law of Nature to all Mankind, which is the common foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                        <p>The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was, for the Moral part, a draught of the loweſt Laws of Nature, which were in great part obliterated and forgotten, by conſtant habits and examples of ſin. And for the Ceremonial and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part, ſitted for that Nation at that place and time, for ſignification of higher Rites and Rules of Perfection that were to come.</p>
                        <p>The Law of Chriſt is the perfection of the Law of Nature, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſo fully before, being the compleat and laſt Will of God for all to walk by for ever.</p>
                        <p>This new and royal Law of Chriſt did refine the Moral, aboliſh the Ceremonial and Judicial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the weakneſs and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs thereof. The Moral part was weak, becauſe it conſiſted of the meaneſt and loweſt Laws of all, and had no Spirit to give ſtrength againſt the committing of ſin, but only to declare it and puniſh it without mercy. And as for the Ceremonial part it was unprofitable, becauſe no part of Natures Law, and only for the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> minority, and was of its own nature to vaniſh as a ſhadow when Chriſt the great Law-giver came, who was the ſubſtance of them all.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore called a <hi>New Commandment,</hi> becauſe it gave forth more ſpiritual and Coeleſtial Precepts, and was eſtabliſhed upon better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and endeared by new inſtances of infinite Love, and gave more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces and aſſiſtances by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, not aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old matter of the Law of Nature by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but ſuperadding thereunto, and ſpiritualizing the ſame to the higheſt ſyſteme of regularity and conformity with Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>So the Kingdom of Heaven was myſtically intimated, but not openly propounded, as a Condition of Gods Contract in the Law, under which there wanted not a ſufficient means to attain unto it, but this was not the Works of the Law it ſelf, but Faith in the Promiſes.</p>
                        <p>And that the wiſer and purer ſort of Jews had ſuch thoughts as theſe, is plain by the queſtion of the Rich man to our Saviour; <hi>Maſter what ſhall I do, that I may have Eternal life?</hi> To which the Anſwer is,<note place="margin">Matt. 19.21.</note>

                        <p>The Souls Immortality and the Reward of good or bad after death, was revealed, though darkly, before the Law: And accordingly their Converſation was then, and under the Law, as Strangers, not yet arrived to their Country.

                        <p>But that the Law ſhould condition this Eternal Life expreſly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, there was no need at that time;<note place="margin">Revelation of Eternal life reſerved.</note> becauſe it was reſerved till the Fulneſs of time, in which the Fulneſs of all Gods promiſes, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of all his precepts ſhould be univerſally proclaimed by his own Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was tendred, as the Civil Law to the Jews, and ſo it was not ſtrange, that God ſhould not covenant farther with them, than to acknowledg him only to be their God, and to ſerve him as he then ſhould appoint, and to depend upon him for their Reward, which was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> immediately ſet before their Eyes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to raiſe them up to outward Obedience at leaſt by that Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but God left them not without witneſs of higher things, giving them to underſtand by his Prophets, that he looked for the inward Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the heart, and that they might expect a greater recompenſe then the Princes of the World were able to beſtow.</p>
                        <p>Theſe carnal Commandements, and Temporal Promiſes, made way,<note place="margin">Temporals prepare for Eternals.</note> as God would have it, for the Spiritual Precepts and Eternal Rewards of the Goſpel, which <hi>Moſes</hi> did not, but Chriſt did covenant for; elſe there had been no need of Chriſt his coming to make a Covenant, which was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49664:52"/> made before, nor of ſo many and great Miracles, when he was come to convince the World, that this was the great meaning and intent of the Law.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Precepts of inward Obedience were tranſlated out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Law into that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the Prophets did often inculcate (becauſe the People were groſs of Underſtanding, readily ſuppoſing at firſt ſight, as all idle and carnal People are apt to do, that an external O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience would anſwer the Letter of the Law well enough) teaching them to regulate the inward Obedience of the heart, which even the Law it ſelf did tacitely require, and their Fathers expreſly taught before the Law was given in Writing.</p>

Some glimmering of theſe things they had in their Sufferings, eſpecially in and after the Captivity, towards the dawning of the day of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when they had loſt the glory of their Land, and were ſubjected to forreign Powers, to ſhew that theſe Temporal felicities were forfeited for their diſobedience, and that they muſt look for a higher Covenant, and Felicities more durable, by embracing a purer Worſhip and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,

                           <note place="margin">Heb. 7.18.</note> 
                           <hi>The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way unto the Holieſt of all was not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49664:54"/> yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding; Which was a Figure for the time then preſent, in which were offered both gifts and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, that could not make them that did the ſervice perfect as pertaining to the Conſcience: which ſtood only in Meats and Drinks and divers waſhings, and carnal Ordinances impoſed on them until the time if Reformation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But all this while, to come upon a Review, it is to be noted, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this weakneſs, there was a Spirit and Life in the Law; yet not ſo ſtrong, as to be able to advance the comers thereunto unto Salvation. Yea, the more ſpiritual and lively it is, the more deadly and fatal it proves to our Carnal mindes, the more it ſearcheth and findeth out ſin, the more it condemns it, but the leſs it ſuppreſſeth it, or provideth any Remedy at all againſt it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Rigour.</note>The Meer Law, as it is the firſt Covenant of Works, contains in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Rigour and Juſtice; but no Grace nor Mercy at all. A Rule it is to declare what is Right and what is Wrong, but no means of it ſelf efficacious to the doing of Right, or the not doing of Wrong. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is an extraordinary Weakneſs therein, as to the Juſtification of a Sinner.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.18. Rom. 8.3.</note> 
                           <hi>What therefore the Law could not do for the weakneſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs thereof, through the fleſh, Chriſt taking the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh. That the Righteouſneſs of the Law, might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit. And that the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus might make us free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <note place="margin">Rom. 7, 5, 6,</note>
                           <hi>For when we were in the fleſh, the Motions of Sin by the Law did work in our Members to bring forth fruit unto Death. But now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter. So ſin taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Commandment works in us all manner of Concupiſcence; For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law ſin is dead, And ſo we were alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, Sin revived and we died. And the Commandment which was ordained to Life, proved in effect to be unto Death. But ſin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion by the Commandment deceived us, and by that Commandment ſlew us. All this while the Law is holy, and the Commandment holy and juſt and good.</hi> And that which is ſo holy and juſt and good is not directly nor truly the Cauſe of our Death, nor can it be ſo, God forbid, by its own Natural operation; for out of good nothing but good can proceed, but Sin, that it might appear ſin, naturally worketh death, by the occaſion of that which is good. For Sin taketh occaſion by the Commandment to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceeding ſinful.</p>

                        <p>THis ſeems to be a myſtery,<note place="margin">Sin deceives.</note> that we ſhould be deceived into ſin by the Law of God. It will not therefore be a Digreſſion, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unprofitable (if it were) to ſhew how a Law, and a good Law, and the Spiritual Law of God in the Old Teſtament ſhould be ſaid by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be though but an occaſion to deceive us into ſin and death.</p>
                        <p>Strange that that which was ſo good, ſhould be made ſo much as the occaſion of Evil, and of the greateſt of Evils to death it ſelf, and the greateſt of deaths to a death in ſin. How then did Sin take this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Commandement of God, firſt to deceive us, and then to kill us, if we can tell?</p>
                        <p>And how great then is the Power of Grace (O the depth of the Riches of God's mercy!) that only can make us alive unto God,<note place="margin">Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceives.</note> and be a death unto Sin, and to the death of Sin, and kill that which would kill us, when nothing elſe can do it? That when Sin did ſo abound by the occaſion of Good, Grace might ſo much the more abound by the occaſion of Evil: For which we muſt thank God, who hath given us this great victory through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                        <p>When therefore Sin urges the ſtrength of the Law againſt us, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the Sword of Juſtice to ſtrike us to death, and that by the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Devil who hath the power of Death; then Grace lays her hand upon the Sword of Juſtice, and ſtops the mouth of Sin, and the clamour of the Law, and of the Devil that lays the Law againſt us, and ſaves us from the ſtroke of Death, and giveth us Victory over all thoſe through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                        <p>So we may be deceived after a ſort by the Law, but we can no waies be deceived by Grace.</p>
                        <p>But yet we have not anſwered this point, How the Law, or rather Sin by the Law, comes to deceive us?</p>

                        <p>This I ſay then, Sin deceives me by miſinforming my Underſtanding and by miſguiding my Will. The Law orders me to life, but Sin deceives me in and by the Law unto death.</p>
                        <p>It will be ſit therefore to conſider here theſe four Points.</p>

                        <p>God praeordained every thing to its proper end. All Unreaſonable Creatures attain their ends; but if they ſhould not, they cannot be ſaid to be deceived, becauſe they underſtood them not, that they might aim at them. Reaſonable Creatures fail of their Ends, becauſe they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their Judgments and Endeavours.</p>
                        <p>God, in the Scriptures, opens and offers Eternal life, and gives me Underſtanding to apprehend it, and a Will to accept it, a Law to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and his Grace to aſſiſt my Humane frailties.</p>

                        <p>Things are in their own nature alwaies the very ſame. Things are here known according to the capacities of our Conceptions, which are as various as Temperaments and Faces.

                        <p>The contrary Principles to what we now maintain have been in credit with our Fore-fathers, as much as ours are now with us; and as we have reverſed theirs, ſo may an After-age reverſe ours: What a caſe then are poor Mortals in!</p>
                        <p>Principles are like Common-wealths, they have their Revolutions and Periods, are altered as Plants removed to different ſoyls.</p>
                        <p>The beſt warrant for Principles, and the ſureſt <hi>Quietus eſt</hi> for Deceit,<note place="margin">Authority.</note> is the authority of ſome Supreme Power; and this, in the caſe of Laws, is the ſureſt courſe that can be taken to avoid Contention. For ſome body muſt determine what is beſt to be ſaid or done; and although their Arreſts and Decrees be not always the beſt, yet they are the beſt that they can make, and therefore they are for our practice for Uniformity and Peace; but if we add conformity of Judgment, becauſe of their Authority, we may quickly be deceived. And ſo for the authority and eſteem that we have of the Ancients ſingly, or in counſel with others of great Piety and Learning, if without enquiry I reſolve to think, ſpeak, or do as they would have me, to live and die and all upon their ſcore, I am fairly deceived upon good authority.</p>

                           <p>I ſtrive againſt the Law, becauſe it ſtrives againſt me, for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto it, and contraries do alwaies oppoſe each other, I am not able to endure it.</p>
                           <p>Before the Law came darting upon me, I ſinned in quiet, and thought my ſelf ſafe, and lived freely; but now I am diſturbed and croſſed in my deſires, and threatned if I do ſo or ſo, I do not like it, I do not call this a life, I am dead to what I was before: But ſtill have a ſtout heart, and I will not be born down if I can help it, by words nor by a few blows.</p>

Prophets propheſie falſly, they dawb with untempered Morter, they preach pleaſing things, ſmooth things, words of deceit. The Prophet is a fool, and the Spiritual man is mad: The blind lead the blind, and the People will be deceived, and make much of them that cauſe them to erre, and love to have it ſo.</p>
                           <p>There are Laws for Fornication, Adultery, Inceſt, Plunder, Piracy, Sacriledge, and all Villanies; but above all, to do the higheſt pieces of Injuſtice under the ſolemn forms of Juſtice, and to waſh their hands and wipe their mouths, and proteſt their Innocency and their Piety too, that they do it for good!</p>
                           <p>There are Laws among Thieves and Robbers, and all unlawful Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Cateline</hi> drinks Blood, and makes the Conſpiratours pledge him.

A cunning Lawyer will pick out enough Law to overthrow many good Laws. Who ſo nice in the Law as thoſe that break Law, and yet ſtudy how to evade the penalty of Law, by Prohibitions from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in Courts Chriſtian, by Protections, by Prerogatives? How many by ſtrictneſs of Law againſt Rogues and Vagabonds, break all Laws of Charity? In a word, How do men ſtudy and take pains to deceive themſelves, and that by the Law too which is good, and ſhould guide them into good; and by Laws which are bad, to juſtifie them to ſome purpoſe in their ungodly deeds?</p>

But the poor man was unjuſtly put to death; becauſe by the Law, it was a capital Crime for any man to draw his Sword upon the Prince: Becauſe the Law intended not to make it death to ſave the Prince's life: Neceſſity in this caſe might have been a ſufficient excuſe if it had been a fault, as it was none.</p>

He came to be Emperour, and they asked of him leave to pull down all the Images in his Dominions; he gave them leave, but when he had done, took them and ſlew them, for asking leave to do ſuch a thing as he had no mind ſhould be done. So he kept not his Promiſe, for he intended not, when he made it, to reward them with a miſchief; but yet he kept his word, becauſe he granted them their Requeſt.</p>

I judge of my Action by any likelyhood of Law, as Idiots do of Coyn, by the general ſtamp and colour, without regard to the mettal. I conſider not, that as all Rules have their exceptions, all Topick Axioms their fallacies, ſo all Laws have their limitations.</p>

The naked Law it ſelf, being a plain and familiar Principle, doth eaſily ſink into my dull brain, and prevails with my popular capacity; but her ampliations and limitations are ſo various and intricate, that it requires more than ordinary ſharpneſs of wit to conceive aright of them.</p>
                        <p>For it is the Crown or Maſterpiece of wiſdom to ſet out fairly the true bounds of a Law, how far it takes effect, and when, and where, and with whom, and why it fails.</p>
                        <p>Again, becauſe I would have my fuller ſwing and career of Liberty, I will not learn nor believe, that my life is ſubject to the controll of many and diverſe Laws, or to the Will of one or more uncontrollable Men, and that ſeveral of thoſe Laws at once may have their ſeveral force in one and the ſame Action.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Weighing my action by one Law.</note>IV. Upon this heedleſsneſs of Underſtanding, or haſtineſs of Will, I weigh mine Action but againſt one Law, when I ſhould counterpoize it with many. Yea, to deal exactly, I ſhould examine it by every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49664:62"/> Law of the whole body, to any whereof my repugnancy makes my Action quite unlawful.</p>
                        <p>For as in Speculation, nothing can be truth that contradicts another truth, ſo in Practice, nothing is lawful which any Law forbids. And when I have canvaſed all the reſpective Laws, and got their conſent, yet I never follow the Rule of my private Reaſon, when the publick ſhould prevail. Rather learn by the wary Uſurer, who in receiving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath a peering eye to the mettal and ſtamp, and tries it alwaies by the Touch-ſtone.</p>

                        <p>Then my Sin hath the caſting voice: ſo, which way ſoever ſhe takes,<note place="margin">Sin hath the caſting voice.</note> ſhe gives the ſcale a twitch, and I reſt ſatisfied, and my Action is down-weight and very lawful.</p>
                        <p>Herein I look not to the Rules that ſhould lead me to the faireſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, To follow in doubtful caſes the ſafeſt, in obſcure the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, in penal the mildeſt, and the largeſt in favourable.</p>
                        <p>But if my ſin be driven with Paſſion or Cuſtome, ſhe preſently cries down that Law for unreaſonable.</p>
                        <p>I conſider not, that where a Law hath no reaſon annexed,<note place="margin">Reaſon of Law.</note> it is hard to find it out, and that ſome Laws have no original reaſon at all. Good reaſon there was for ſome final determination one way or other, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deliberation, no prevalent reaſon appearing why this way rather than that way: The laſt Reſolution was from the will and pleaſure of the Legiſlator, as a matter only indifferent which way, but neceſſary, as far as might be gueſſed, to pitch upon this way.</p>
                        <p>Thus Law or no Law, good Law or bad Law, my ſin deceives me, though differently. Without the Law ſhe is liveleſs, but by the Law lawleſs.</p>
                        <p>Let me then no more blame the Caſuiſts, that they teach Sin, leaſt the like aſperſion fall upon all Law. All Law may be caſual, any ſo infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that thence I may take leave to ſin.</p>
                        <p>For my Luſt is ſo lawleſs, that by learning the Law it will learn to ſin, and yet my Luſt ſo legal, that for any ſin it will pretend a law.</p>
                        <p>So that as it is true on Sin's part, <hi>Ex malis moribus naſcuntur bonae Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> Good Laws ſpring from evil manners: ſo it is true on the Law's part, <hi>Ex bonis Legibus naſcuntur mali mores,</hi> Evil manners ariſe from good Laws. In a word, Sin gives occaſion to ſome Laws, but takes occaſion from any Laws.</p>

                        <p>Slavery is a ſtate of ſervitude, the Tenure whereby it holds is Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; bond ſervice; whence ſuch as are under that yoke are called Bond ſervants, or Bond ſlaves.</p>
                        <p>The words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and <hi>Servus</hi> are equivocal, and ſignifie two degrees of Servants, not kinds.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A Free ſervant, that lets out his ſervice by contract freely.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A Bond ſervant, whoſe ſervice is conſtrained and forced from him.</p>
                        <p>The offices of a Wife to a Husband, a Son to a Father, a Servant to a Maſter, are not only ſervices, but free ſervices.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are all temporary, and expire; as the ſervice of the Wiſe by the Husband's death, for then ſhe is free from the Law of her Husband: As the Son in full Age is no longer under Tutours and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: As the Servant, after the time of Contract is expired, is free from the Law of his Maſter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are certain, and have limited and diſtinct offices; as the duties of a Wife, Son, and Servant, are diſtinct one from another.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe they are meritorious, and have ſeveral rewards for their ſervices; as the Wife hath her Dower, the Son his Portion, the Servant his Wages.</p>
                        <p>But the ſervice of the Slave is a bondage, a miſerable ſervice, contrary to the former.</p>

                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49664:63"/>1. Becauſe it is perpetual, the time thereof is timeleſs; for Bondage is a mutual Inheritance entailed to the Lord and the Slave, and to their Heirs for ever: The Lord being lord to the Slave and his heirs for ever, and the Slave being ſlave to the Lord and his heirs for ever.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is arbitrary; for the works and ſervices thereof are uncertain, <hi>pro libitu Domini,</hi> according to the will of the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is unprofitable; no reward for the Slave, but his labour for his pains and ſtripes to boot, or pains for his pains. All profits that ariſe by the Slave, or his Wife and Children, and his and their gains ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Lord of them all, and all they have or do: Therefore Bondage is a barren or fruitleſs ſervice.</p>
                        <p>Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the houſe of Bondage, their ſervice was hereditary, arbitrary, and unprofitable, at pleaſure of their Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, and no wages, but a charge to find ſtraw, and be beaten for not performing their daily tasks.</p>

                        <p>THE ſeat of Slavery is the Spirit:<note place="margin">The Soul.</note> A bondage on the Soul and her faculties.</p>
                        <p>The bondage of the Body is a grievous burthen, but it is not the true ſlavery: For a man's Body may be moved to and fro, and ſet on work to dig, or draw, or tug at an Oar, or any other beaſtly works, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will and command of a Tyrant; but the Will all this while is free, to act according to the mind and reaſon of a Man.</p>
                        <p>So a vertuous ingenuous Man is ſpiritually and truly free inwardly, in his mind, to know and do better things, though outwardly in his Body he be a ſlave at the will of another, as if he had no will of his own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot uſe it to the guidance of his Corporal actions; but he hath a will free to the actions of his Soul.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a bodily Bondſlave to his Miſtreſs, to do her lawful commands, but was ſpiritually free, and refuſed to be ſubdued to her Luſt. He was more free than ſhe: He only a ſlave Corporal to her bodily power, ſhe a ſlave ſpiritual to her own baſe and filthy deſires. <hi>Joſeph</hi> endures not ſo baſe a bondage, chuſes rather to lye faſt bound in the dungeon, and let the Iron enter into his Soul.</p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:49664:64"/>
                        <p>Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſlaves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> under the Iron yoke of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> but free in the ſervice of God to wait for his Promiſes. So in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, they were ſlaves in body, yet free to ſerve the Lord, and would not ſing the ſongs of <hi>Sion</hi> in a ſtrange Land.</p>
                        <p>Give me any ſlavery, but the ſlavery of the Soul: I had rather they ſhould bind me in Chains, and load me with bolts and fetters of Iron; make me tug at an Oar, dig in a Mine, or draw in a Wagon, than take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the free uſe of that little Underſtanding which God hath given me.</p>
                        <p>I value the liberty of my Body, to go when and whither I pleaſe, and to do what and how I have a mind to; but I value the liberty of my Soul at a far higher rate, to judge and reſolve according to the beſt of my skill and underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Mammon</hi> is the falſe Riches of Unrighteouſneſs, not the true and right riches: but Wiſdom is the true riches of the Spirit; ſo bondage or Corporeal ſlavery is the falſe ſlavery of Unrighteouſneſs, but the true ſlavery is of the Soul and Spirit. If therefore the Spirit be enthralled, as it ſhould not be, how great is that thraldom! and if the Spirit be free, as it ſhould be, how great is that freedom!</p>

                           <hi>For where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty.</hi> The conduct of the Spirit of freedom is the great freedom of the ſpirit: The Leader makes the Follower free; <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God,</hi>

                           <hi>they are the Sons of God,</hi> Gods Free-men.</p>
                        <p>The Will is naturally free by its firſt creation, but now it comes to be ſupernaturally free by its New creation.</p>
                        <p>So the Will draws nearer and nearer to God in Liberty, till it comes to the <hi>meaſure of the fulneſs of the ſtature of Chriſt;</hi> till it comes to will nothing but good, and can do no otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Spirits of Juſt men are made perfectly free.</p>
                        <p>Neceſſary willing of Good, without haeſitancy from within, or coaction from without, is the greateſt freedom. Gods neceſſary doing of all good, and impoſſibility of doing of any evil, is his perfection.</p>
                        <p>Neceſſary willing of Evil, without haeſitancy from within, or coaction from without, is the greateſt ſlavery. Satans neceſſity of all evil, and impoſſibility of doing any good, is his imperfection.</p>
                        <p>Gods Spirit is perfect and abſolute Freedom, that makes the ſpirits of Juſt men and Angels perfectly and abſolutely free.</p>
                        <p>Satans ſpirit is perfect and abſolute bondage, that makes the ſpirits of Unjuſt men and Angels perfectly and abſolutely ſlaviſh. For,</p>
                        <p>The Spirits of Angels and Men, though naturally they be free, yet acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally they may be bound, as in divers caſes.</p>
                        <p>Satan himſelf and his Crue are all Spirit, yet every Wizard pretends to bind them.<note place="margin">Jud. 6.</note> But God doth indeed bind him and them, <hi>reſerving them in chains of Darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great day.</hi>

                        <p>The Spirit of Man is free, yet may it be religiouſly bound by a <hi>Vow</hi> or <hi>Oath,</hi> Numb. 30.2. and is ſhamefully bound by luſt of Fleſh, the pride of World, and the Temptations of the Devil, and too often led captive by him according to his will.</p>
                        <p>Now the bondage of the Spirit is the true, right and perfect ſlavery; becauſe the Spirit is naturally free, and the more free a thing is naturally, the more ſlaviſh is the bondage thereof, for therein is the greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the greater violence makes the greater ſlavery.</p>

                        <p>For a man then to be reſtrained from true happineſs, that he cannot or may not be happy, that he cannot or may not know or enjoy God, this is true ſlavery.

                        <p>The proper Guide of Man, that leads him to his proper End, and moves him to all actions mediating thereunto, is right Reaſon, or as the Scripture terms it, a right Spirit; whether natural from himſelf, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural from God.</p>
                        <p>For right Reaſon, enlightned and quickned by Grace, becomes a right Spirit: And even that Holy Spirit which moves in the Saints, is but right Reaſon, ſublimated above Nature and exalted into Grace.</p>
                        <p>This right Spirit ſhould be the proper ſpring or plummet of Man, to move the ſtrings and wheels of the Soul in her elicit or imperate acts.</p>
                        <p>All other guides, as the paſſions of Love, Fear and Anger, are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto him, for they are rather troublers than leaders, hangers on than furtherers; hence they are called Perturbations, diſturbing and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the fair Soul, as ſickneſs and lameneſs the Body.</p>
                        <p>Now for a man to be reſtrained from his proper guide, that he cannot or may not follow a right Spirit, but muſt be forced after a forreign Leader, after that Spirit which Satan ſuggeſts, or thoſe Luſts that the Fleſh preſcribes, to be at a beck to every Paſſion, and ſerve his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, this is ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>Hence, when Subjects are governed by their own proper Prince, that hath a true right and title to the Crown, they account themſelves Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but when forced under an Uſurper, that hath no true right or title to the Crown, they reckon themſelves to be no leſs than ſlaves. Much more doth he make a ſlave of himſelf, that is led away by his own luſt, and admits of a guide that hath no right to govern him at all.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Reſtraint from proper Act.</note>III. A Reſtraint of Man from his proper Act is true ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>The proper Act of Man, whereby he negotiates and performs the deeds of a man, is his Will: To chuſe or refuſe of his own will, to conſent or diſſent to the will of another, and afterwards to execute and perform his choice and conſent.</p>
                        <p>Hence the acts of the Will are called by Divines, <hi>Actus humani,</hi> the proper Acts of man, whereby he ſtands in the rank of Man. All other Acts, as Appetites that flow not from the Will, or Errors and Miſtakes that fall beſides the Will, or Conſtraints that run againſt the Will, are improper and alien to Man, and common to him with Beaſts.</p>
                        <p>Thus for a man to be reſtrained from his proper Act, that he cannot or may not chuſe or refuſe, that he cannot or may not conſent or diſſent, or that he can will or nill, but not execute at all, but is forced from his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49664:65"/> own will to act the will of another, this is true ſlavery. Of this St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains, that he had a Will of his own, but could not act it, but the contrary; <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform I find not; for the good that I would I do not,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 7.18.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>By the Civil Law, the Slave can make no Will; <hi>Servo nulla Teſtamenti factio.</hi> The Slave alſo can be no Party to a Will, neither a Teſtatour, Executor, or ſo much as a Witneſs. Naturally he may write or ſpeak his own mind, or teſtifie the mind of another; but legally he cannot do it, he is dead in Law.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. A Reſtraint of Man from his proper Rule is true ſlavery.<note place="margin">Reſtraint from proper Rule.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The proper Rule of a man, to frame and ſteer his Actions by, is the Law, as the Law of God, which is alwaies juſt; or of Man, which is then alwaies juſt, when no Law of God declares it unlawful.</p>
                        <p>The Law, not Conſcience, is the Soveraign rule of Man: For the Conſcience muſt have a Law for the rule of it, or elſe it will be unruly; for where there is no Law, there can be no Conſcience, ſeeing Conſcience is but the dictate of the law of Equity; a law preſcribing to the law of Juſtice, and overruling it. And Conſcience pretended is but blindneſs of mind, or hardneſs of heart, unleſs it can ſee or feel it ſelf in ſome Law.</p>
                        <p>All other Rules, as Favour and Fear, Humour, Fancy and Pleaſure, are improper unto man, alien and forreign, for they are leaden and crooked Rules, that cauſe us to wander in crooked waies: So for a man to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from his proper Rule, ſo that he cannot, or may not, live by the Law, but is forced to live contrary to Law, only at the will and pleaſure of another, this is true ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>Hence, when Subjects are ruled by their own Municipal and National Laws, that are genuine and proper to them, they account themſelves free men; but when ruled by forreign and ſtrange Laws, or by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prince in an arbitrary uncertain way, ſuch ſubjection is called Slavery.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The proper State of Man, whereby he is ranked diſtinct and ſuperiour to all other ſublunary Creatures, is to be a perſon living in the condition of a Reaſonable Soul.</p>
                        <p>All other Eſtates, whether they proceed from Titles, Degrees or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are improper unto Man, alien and forreign to him, for none of theſe advance him to the rank of Man. Now for a man to be reſtrained from his proper State, that he cannot, or may not, live in the perſon of Man; but is forced to a ſtate below Man in the condition of a Beaſt, or is yet farther forced to a ſtate below a Beaſt, and to live in the condition of the Dead, alive in Nature, but dead in Law, this is true ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>Hence Slaves by the Civil Law are made equivalent to Beaſts,<note place="margin">F.L.

                        <p>The proper Right of Man, whereby he claims any thing to be his own, is the right and claim of himſelf over himſelf, to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety poſſeſſion and government, as to be Maſter of himſelf, and have the uſe and fruit of himſelf.</p>
                        <p>This is his original Right, whereby he was not only morally righteous, but had a legal right over the Creatures; <hi>Ergo,</hi> much more over himſelf.</p>
                        <p>All other rights, whereby he enjoys Houſes, Lands or Goods, are improper to Man, alien and forreign, not natural but poſitive, grounded upon humane Contracts.</p>
                        <p>Now for a man to be reſtrained from his proper Right, that he cannot or may not have propriety, poſſeſſion or uſufruct of himſelf, but is forced to become the propriety, poſſeſſion and uſufruct of another, by ſelling, or letting, or loſing the free-hold of himſelf; this is true ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>Hence the Civil Law deſcribes ſlavery to be ſubjection, <hi>Contra natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram dominio alterius,</hi> and, <hi>Servus dicitur nullius Juris:</hi> Againſt Nature for a man not to be his own, but another's man, and to have right to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not ſo much as to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>When Subjects have not the property of their Goods, they count themſelves ſlaves: If he be rightly ſtiled a ſlave that hath not property in any goods, much more is he a ſlave that hath no property of himſelf.</p>

                        <p>For as Reſtraint from good makes ſlavery, ſo Conſtraint to evil makes ſlavery out of meaſure ſlaviſh.</p>
                        <p>Hence the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſlaves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> conſtrained to make Bricks, and Pots of Clay. The Prodigal was a ſlave to the Citizen, to feed his Swine, and yet not to be ſed with them. The Poſſeſſed in the Goſpel were ſlaves to Satan, and forced often by him into the fire and water.</p>
                        <p>Put all theſe three together, and they ſhew the full Nature of ſlavery, that is, bondage of Spirit, reſtraining Man from his ſeveral properties, and conſtraining him to their ſeveral contraries. The uſe of all is, to ſhew thee thy Error. Thou complaineſt of Temporal ſlavery, it is a falſe and counterfeit ſlavery, the Spiritual ſlavery is the true ſlavery: To feel the burthen of that, and complain of the miſery, would argue a good increaſe of God's grace in thee; and if God's grace free thee from that ſlavery, then art thou free from all the World, which God grant.</p>

                        <p>THE Lord of ſlavery is Sin; Servant of ſin. Of which ſin?<note place="margin">The Lord of ſlavery, Sin.</note> not of that he commits, for that is actual ſin, which is the Sinner's work; but the ſinner is the ſervant of ſin Original.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſin Original is the lord, and makes him a ſlave to work ſin Actual.</p>
                        <p>Original ſin is indeed in the godly, not as a lord; <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over them, for they are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> But that ſin is in them as a ſlave, over whom they domineer. They mortifie and crucifie it, and make it a dying ſin; <hi>They that are Chriſts do crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Original ſin is in the ſinner as a Lord, an Inmate that domineers, doth mortifie and crucifie the ſinner till he be deſtroyed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe Original ſin reſtrains him from all his ſeveral properties; from his proper end, Eternal happineſs; from his proper guide, a right Spirit; from his proper act of chooſing good and refuſing evil; from his proper rule, the Law of God; from his proper ſtate, a perſon after God's image; from his proper right, the propriety and poſſeſſion of himſelf, and conſtrains him to actual ſins, which are vile and baſe acts.</p>
                        <p>If the ſinner be thus reſtrained to be a ſlave, then Original ſin that reſtrains him is his Lord; becauſe whatſoever reſtrains, is Lord and Maſter over him that is reſtrained.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe Original ſin reigns over the ſinner. She is a Tyrant, uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſoveraignty, and hath her Laws whereby to command him; thoſe laws are but ſeveral luſts, <hi>i. e.</hi> her arbitrary will and pleaſure: <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the godly it reigns not, for they obey it not; but in the ſinner it reigns, for he obeys it: <hi>his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, whether it be to Sin or Righteouſneſs.</hi> If then thou obey Righteouſneſs, thou art a free ſervant; but if Sin, a bond-ſlave, and the more willingly thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeſt, the more ſlave thou art.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But the Sinner's chief Lord is Satan; <hi>The Prince of the Air,</hi>

                        <p>Satan is a warlike Prince, fights daily againſt the Saints.

                        <p>All theſe Spirits are enemies to the godly, for he fights againſt them; but they are Commanders over the Sinner, for he ſerves under them. As the poor <hi>Gadaren</hi> had a Legion of Devils that poſſeſt him, ſo the poor Sinner hath a Legion of Lords that command him.</p>
                        <p>This makes the ſlavery out of meaſure ſlaviſh, becauſe the multitude of Lords doth multiply ſlavery.</p>
                        <p>For one Father to have many Children is an honour, but for one Child to have many Fathers, to be <hi>Filius populi,</hi> is true Baſeneſs and Baſtardy: So for one Lord to have many Slaves is a glory, but for one Slave to have many Lords, is extreme Baſeneſs and Slavery.</p>
                        <p>The Uſe of all is to draw thee from Sin, becauſe ſin is true ſlavery. Thou deteſteſt Slavery in the leaſt degree, when it bars thee of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of thy Goods, and wilt thou endure the ſlavery of Sin, the baſeſt-ſlavery that is?</p>
                        <p>Wilt thou fear the higheſt degree of it, when it bars thee from the propriety of thy ſelf, and forces thee to vile and baſe acts? Set thy Soul againſt this ſlavery, by ſtriving to oppoſe it, and God give thee grace to be free from it, for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Tranſition.</note>NOtwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid of the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the Law, and of the deceit and bondage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſtill the Law is holy, juſt and good, becauſe God is ſo that made it: That muſt needs be Spiritual, becauſe God is a Spirit. A thing therefore may be the occaſion of ſin, though in it ſelf it be never ſo harmleſs: As all the good Creatures of God, which being abuſed groan again after their manner, and long to be delivered from their ſervitude. So the Law of God gives no occaſion to Sin of it ſelf, but Luſt takes occaſion from the Law, to ſtir up ſin contrary to the Law: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law retorts upon Sin again to condemn it ſo much the more, and to puniſh it ſo much the more. So that the effect of the Law through the ſinfulneſs of ſin is to work ſin and wrath, deceit, fear and bondage, and to hold men down continually under this trembling condition all their life long through the horrour of death.</p>
                        <p>And the Law of Morality, beſides the penalty of ſcourging, or Death without mercy annexed thereunto to keep men from Tranſgreſſions, hath alſo a Ceremonial Yoke to put upon the Shoulders of ſuch, as otherwiſe would fall to Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which altogether could not do, but was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49664:69"/> Yoke too heavy for them to bear. And therefore the Law it ſelf, for that part thereof which was Typical and Ritual, fell of it ſelf, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unprofitable, and that ſmall part thereof, which was Moral, fell not, but longed for greater perfection, and Grace to be added above the Juſtice and Rigour, which was ſo ineffectual; and accordingly the Law was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Inſufficiency thereof, as it was but the loweſt part of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and was fulfilled to the higheſt pitch of Spiritual Perfection by Chriſt, who came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it. And thoſe that were under this Law, either written or not written, either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> were delivered from this State of Bondage and Fear into the glorious liberty of the Children of God.</p>
                        <p>So the Law of Juſtice muſt needs be a juſt Law to direct, and a ſevere Law to puniſh; and when it had directed and puniſhed, it did all it could do, but reformed none from Sin, at leaſt inwardly, nor ſaved none from Puniſhment; ſo that ſtill it left men ſinful, as it found them, and more too, and left men miſerable, as it ſound them, and more too: So that there is an Impoſſibility, that ever any man ſhould be ſaved by the Law, and an Impoſſibility that any man can be ſaved by any thing but Grace.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. In all God's Diſpenſations he giveth us to underſtand.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Law of nature was not ſufficient to keep man in the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, in which he was created, becauſe he was deceived by his Luſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt which that Law gave him no ſtrength; by the ſtrength of his Will, he might have ſtood, but not by the ſtrength of the Law: So he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in that.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That when the Law of Nature came to be written, for him to read with his bodily eyes, as he might before with the eyes of his mind, yet ſtill it would not do.</p>
                        <p>And when Poenal Laws were added, they might keep him in bondage and bodily fear of Death, as they did, but never ſecure him from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, nor ſpare him, when he did offend, and ſtill it would not do.</p>
                        <p>So Juſtice ſtill ſhews us every way, and by the Law ſo much the more.</p>
                        <p>So the Law deceives us by ſhewing us the way, into which it had no power to put us, but left us to take that right way, and threatned us if we ſhould offer to leave it.</p>
                        <p>So ſtill alas! we are deceived by Law and Juſtice, which both intended us good, but our own Luſt hindred it from coming upon us.</p>
                        <p>But as for Grace and Mercy, they can no way deceive us,<note place="margin">Grace cannot deceive.</note> nor will they ſuffer our Luſt to deceive us: Law and Juſtice in themſelves do not deceive us, but Luſt does properly deceive us by them.</p>
                        <p>Grace and Mercy in themſelves do our Work for us, and can no way deceive us directly nor indirectly. Law and Juſtice, though they did not directly deceive us, yet Luſt did for all them, for they could not help it, though they ſtood by all the while, and looked on.</p>
                        <p>But Grace and Mercy, they do no ways deceive us, nor ſuffer us to deceived.</p>
                        <p>So that there is more power in Grace and Mercy, than in Law and Juſtice: For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through Luſt, that Grace did do, in that it was ſtrong through Faith: And not only condemned Sin in the fleſh, as the Law did not, but deſtroyed Sin
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49664:70"/> in the fleſh and out of the fleſh, as the Law could not do, by Chriſt's taking in mercy our Fleſh upon him.</p>
                        <p>See how God gives us wonderfully to underſtand the power of his Juſtice to humble us for ſin, ſo much condemned and puniſhed in us, and to know the greater power of his Mercy to raiſe us up from ſin, ſo much pardoned and unpuniſhed in us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. God put Mankind under the adminiſtration of the Law of Juſtice, to convince him of his ſin, and of God's juſt wrath: That he might ſee there was no help for him in himſelf, nor from any Creature, no not from God's Law it ſelf; that he might abhor himſelf, and bewail his ſin, and look out for a farther remedy, than the Law could afford: That he might renounce and diſclaim all beſide God, and take him only for his helper, by flying from the Throne of his Law and Juſtice to the ſeat of his Grace and Mercy, admiring and praiſing the ſuperexcellency of his Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all his Works, and for ever after deny any hope or comfort in any thing, ſave in the free Grace of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God put Man under the adminiſtration of the Goſpel of Grace, to convince him of God's love and favour unſought for and undeſerved: That he might ſee that there was help in the Creatour alone; that he might adore and praiſe his Redeemer, and rejoyce in his Love, and enjoy his Rewards in full ſatisfaction to his Soul for ever.</p>
                        <p>O the riches of the glory of God's Grace, that hath done more than his Law or Juſtice could do! We ſhould never have been undeceived, nor unpuniſhed, without Grace, but had been for ever ſinful and miſerable without it; but now, if we will, we may be for ever holy and happy with it.</p>
                        <p>There was a ſpirit of Rule and Direction in the Law; there is a ſpirit of Help and Aſſiſtance in the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>There was a ſpirit of Anger and Wrath in the Law; there is a ſpirit of Love and Favour in the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>There was a ſpirit of Puniſhment and Death in the Law; there is a ſpirit of Pardon and Life in the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>So God attains to his ends and deſigns by Grace. His end and deſign is to ſave, and in order thereto to relinquiſh the rigour of his Juſtice, and draw them out of the fire that, run into it, by the offer of his Grace. To throw out a cord of Love to them that will catch hold of it, after they have plunged themſelves into a gulf of wickedneſs. So much God delights in his beſt and greateſt Works.</p>
                        <p>And now after all this, if we will not be ſaved, but ſin wilfully, or truſt to our own Righteouſneſs, we can have no excuſe.</p>
                        <p>Before men might ſay ſomething, though not ſufficient, that they had no ſtrength to avoid ſin, though they had ſufficient from that diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace that then was; and that the Law made them know and deſire ſin more, though not properly this laſt, to make them deſire it; but becauſe forbidden, therefore their Luſt made them the more deſire it.</p>
                        <p>But now, what can they ſay? They are ſinful and therefore miſerable. Here is Grace to make them holy and happy.</p>
                        <p>What ſhall they do to be ſaved? They muſt accept this Grace, and they ſhall be ſaved by it.</p>
                        <p>Will they accept, or will they not? If they will they may, nothing hinders them; <hi>They are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49664:70"/>
                        <p>The Luſt in their Members ſtrives to hinder them, but cannot without their conſent. The World and the Devil tempt them, by their Luſt to hinder them, but cannot without their conſent.</p>
                        <p>This is the laſt and great Remedy of Sin and Miſery; this will do, if men will take it, elſe nothing can do. How can a ſick man be cured, that will not take his Medicine? How can any thing do any man good againſt his will? Salvation it ſelf cannot ſave thoſe that will not be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>Now every mouth muſt be ſtopped. God can, nor will do no more than he hath done: <hi>What could I have done more for my Vineyard, which I have not done? &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He hath given the World to underſtand his two great diſpenſations of the Law and Goſpel.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. How the Law was a Rule to direct and reward thoſe that kept it, and puniſh them that broke it; but Luſt by it deceived us into ſin and miſery.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How the Goſpel is a Help, as well as a Rule, to ſave thoſe that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; and Luſt cannot deceive us by it into ſin or miſery, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and refuſal may and will dam up all hope.</p>
                        <p>God therefore hath left off his Threats and Poenal diſpenſations, to all faithful Souls. Though he do inflict ſome Judgments as he did before, yet not in that manner, nor for that end as formerly.</p>
                        <p>The Unbelieving are juſtly puniſhed, but the Faithful are fatherly corrected: This is a diſpenſation of mercy even in Afflictions to them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The aſſiſtances of the Spirit, and the comforts thereof, do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompenſe and moderate the pains of the fleſh.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The hope of Rewards engages them againſt hope to believe in hope.</p>
                        <p>Still God draws by the cords of Love, by Perſwaſions and Entreaties, not by Threats or Compulſions. Underſtand therefore O Man, the work of God's grace toward thee.</p>
                        <p>Whereas by Law and the Righteouſneſs thereof, thou art deceived in truſting to thy ſelf, breaking the Law by Luſt: By Grace and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, thou art not deceived in truſting to Chriſt, fulfilling the Law by love.</p>
                        <p>A Covenant of Works by Law could not ſave thee, for they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal only: A Covenant of Faith by Grace can ſave thee by internal Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>So, no Salvation by Law or Covenant of Works for outward Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: But by the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace, by inward Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. This is Faith, this is the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>

                        <p>Indeed the kingdom of Heaven is not expreſſed in the Letter, but in the Spirit of the Law, which all did not perceive, elſe how ſhould the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> part of the moſt Learned, and many among the Prieſts and of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> not diſcern it? <hi>Vide</hi> Act. 4.1, 6. and 5.17. and 23.6.</p>
                        <p>The Promiſes of the Law are plainly extant, Exod. 16.27, 28. and 19.5, 6. and 23.25. Deut. 26.16. and 27.28, 29, 30. Lev. 25. <hi>per totum.</hi> Heb. 7.19. and 8.6. and 9.15. and 7.16. and 9.9, 14. 2 Tim. 1.9, 10. Math. 22.36.</p>

                        <p>Now theſe Carnal Rewards were not proportionable to a Spiritual Law, therefore the Law was Carnal as the Promiſes were: For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts that are of perpetual right are in their office Carnal, if they be exerted no farther than the meaſures of a Carnal life. As the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>loving our Neighbour</hi> reſpected only the duty of a Civil life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe the ſame offices of Civility were forbidden to be exerciſed by them towards the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites, Idumaeans,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Deut. 23.3, 6, 8. and 25.17, 18, 19.

                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe Precepts were given upon the account of hindering the infection of Idolatry, by too much familiarity of Conſanguinity, Affinity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of Converſation: And theſe very Enemies of God's People were figures of the Enemies of all Chriſtians. And this ſenſe of the Law in this caſe Chriſt himſelf does declare in the Parable of him that fell among Thieves.<note place="margin">Luk. 19.29.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>By this way and method, if due care were taken, the Scriptures might be underſtood, and the Word of Truth rightly divided, and things new and old exactly diſtinguiſhed, and the difference between Judaiſm and Chriſtianity exactly ſtated.</p>
                        <p>By this one diſtinction of a Myſtical and Literal ſenſe the Law of Works might be diſcerned from the Law of Grace, the Righteouſneſs of the Law from the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel.</p>

And yet the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and example in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had much forgotten the Old Rules of Nature's Law, and the Inſtructions and Examples of their godly Parents: and imputed not their own ſin unto themſelves, becauſe they ſaw no Law written againſt their Actions, and could not ſee the Law in their own hearts,<note place="margin">Ro. 5.13, 20.</note> neither heard of any puniſhment denounced againſt them for their wickedneſs, and would not hear the checks of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, becauſe Sin was in them and increaſed, and death reigned over them for their ſin; yet they being without a written Law to evidence this ſin and death unto their Conſciences, God ſaw it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that there ſhould be a New Edition and publication of the Law or Covenant of Works, to bring them to the knowledge of Sin and Puniſhment, and thereby to ſtop them in their career of Wickedneſs, by the fear of a Curſe, and a Fleſhly hope of a fruitful Land to dwell in, if they would obſerve his Laws: Reſerving a greater Bleſſing if they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49664:73"/> would truſt in his Promiſes, which was the Covenant of Grace, by which they were to be juſtified upon their Faith in thoſe Promiſes, and not by the Works of the Law. So the Law was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till Juſtification ſhould ome by the Promiſe of Grace.</p>
                        <p>For the Law was weak and unprofitable to the purpoſe of Salvation, but helpful to the diſcovery and ſtopping of Sin and the Curſe, that they might ſee the need they had of the Grace of God, by which they might be ſaved, and not by Works.</p>
                        <p>For as the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> had been needleſs, if the Covenant of Works could have given Life: So after the Promiſe or Covenant of Grace was once made, it had been needleſs to renew the Covenant of Works, to the end that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Life ſhould be had thereby.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> It was meerly added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, that is, not ſet up as a ſolid thing in groſs, ſufficient of it ſelf; but added, or put to the former Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was moſt forgotten. Furthermore, this Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by way of ſubſerviency and attendance, the better to advance and make effectual the Covenant of Grace: ſo that although the ſame Covenant which was made with <hi>Adam</hi> was renewed on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> yet I ſay ſtill, it was not for the ſame purpoſe, but it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a Rule of Salvation by it ſelf, if he had kept it; but it was renewed only to help forward, and to introduce another and better Covenant, and ſo to be a Manuduction unto Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Obſerve it then, that all this while there was no other way of life given either in whole, or in part, beſide the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                        <p>And therefore there was no inconſtancy, either in God's Will, or in his Acts; only ſuch was his Mercy, that he ſubordinated the Covenant of Works, and made it ſubſervient to the Covenant of Grace, and ſo to tend to Evangelical Perfection. And he that truly underſtands and conſiders what the Covenant of Works requires, and how unable he is to perform it, it being, though ordained for righteouſneſs and life, an occaſion of ſin and death, muſt needs ſee juſt cauſe to flie from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> unto Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> or from the Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Covenant of Grace made with Chriſt, and to admire the unſpeakable Wiſdom and Mercy of God, in ſuffering the Law to enter in,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20, 21.</note> that <hi>the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence might abound, that where Sin aboundeth, Grace might much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. That as ſin hath raigned unto death, even ſo might Grace raign, through Righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. The Law then which was good, was not made Death unto me, God forbid, But Sin that it might appear ſin, working death in me by that which is good;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 7.13.</note> 
                           <hi>that ſin by the Commandment might become exceeding ſinful. Is the Law then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Promiſes of God? God forbid: For if there had been a Law given, which could have given life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gal. 3.22, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that believe. But before Faith came we were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith, which ſhould afterward be revealed. Wherefore the Law was our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith. But after that Faith is come, we are no longer under a School-maſter. For ye are the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                        <p>The obſcurity of this Great Point of Theology, which I am forced to be ſo long upon (new Notions ariſing continually) is chiefly occaſioned
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49664:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> as <hi>Origen</hi> imagineth, by the indiſtinct Aequivocation of the Word Law in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> let that place be viewed, where it is ſaid, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 6.2, 3. The Aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Word Law.</note> 
                           <hi>for what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh. That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>May we not modeſtly ſay, that the Word Law aſcribed to the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the Fleſh is not properly, but abuſively given? As it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in another Place,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.21, 23.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>I find a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me; for I delight in the Law of God after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man: But I ſee another Law in my members warring againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in my Members.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For if Luſt be a Law, and do bind, it hath no Right ſo to do; becauſe Luſt is not of force by God's Prime Inſtitution, from whence Law hath its virtue; but by the occaſion of his Juſtice in puniſhing the Fall of our firſt Parents thereby.</p>
                        <p>And hence is this Original way of ſinning from our Luſts, which we are led away with, and deceived by; though in themſelves they are not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſinful, but became exorbitant againſt reaſon, and peccant upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden objects, by our own conſent of Will, and God's juſt Puniſhment therefore.</p>
                        <p>But when the Law of the Spirit of life is clearly meant to be the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached, and alone having the Promiſe of the Spirit; The Law that is weak becauſe of the Fleſh, that is condemned by the fleſh of Chriſt, muſt needs be underſtood to be a carnal Law, from whence Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can never be hoped.</p>
                        <p>But that Law, by which Juſtification is had by them which walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit, and not after the Fleſh, is Spiritual; whether it be the ſame for the Law of Nature, perfected by Chriſt for the Covenant of Grace, or diverſe, as commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Covenant of Works.</p>
                        <p>When theſe things are rightly diſtinguiſhed, the difficulty, whereof St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as <hi>Origen</hi> complains, is taken off: for when the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> 
                           <hi>That the Gentiles which have not a Law, are a Law unto themſelves, doing by Nature the things contained in the Law, ſhew the Work of the Law written in their hearts;</hi> It is manifeſt, that although we uſurp the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law of Nature indifferently; St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth abſtain from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Name of a Law to that Light that is in us, when he ſays the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> had no Law, but were a Law to themſelves: becauſe the uſurping of the Name Law, belongs to the ſolemn Impoſition of that name in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to the Law of Nature and of ſin but by Trope and Figure.</p>
                        <p>The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is carnal in all men, the Covenant of Works. The Law of Chriſt is Spiritual in the Faithful, before, under, and after the Law, the Covenant of Grace. Therefore the Inſtitutions of Nature in <hi>Moſes's</hi> Law, are Scriptures and the Word of God, no leſs than the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but not binding as delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but by Chriſt, by whom they were made perfect. Neither doth a Believer receive the Moral Law at the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but altogether at the hands of Chriſt. Though it be the ſame Law for Matter and Subſtance, yet in the loweſt grounds that was delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet Believers are not to receive it as the Law
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49664:74"/> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of Chriſt in the higheſt perfections thereof. For when Chriſt the Son of God comes and ſpeaks himſelf, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of God muſt hold his peace, as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf foretold, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 3.22.</note> 
                           <hi>Him ſhall you hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> And therefore in the Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were departed and had given place, the voice from Heaven came and ſaid,<note place="margin">Math. 17.5.</note> 
                           <hi>This is my Well-beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye Him. And though heretofore God hath ſpoken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes and in ſundry faſhions to the World by his Servants the Prophets,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> 
                           <hi>yet now in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken to us by his Son;</hi> and this is he that we muſt truſt to.</p>
                        <p>And they that believed in <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt believe in Chriſt; and they that believed before <hi>Moſes</hi> did believe in Chriſt; and they that believe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt believe in Chriſt; and ſo to the World's end. For there never was, nor will be any other name by which the World can be ſaved, but only by the name of Chriſt; who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever; in whom all the Promiſes of God are Yea and Amen. There have been different Diſpenſations, but the ſame Grace. Yet ſtill I ſay, Believers were never under the Law, as it was the Covenant of Works, were allways under the Law, as it was the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expounds the Hiſtory of the two Twins,<note place="margin">Hom. 42. in Gen. Gen. 38.30.</note> which <hi>Thamar</hi> brought forth by her Father in Law <hi>Judah,</hi> by the Myſtery of Chriſtians and Jews. By God's appointment he that firſt put forth his hand was laſt born; that thereby might be ſignified the entrance of the Law, which yielded unto Faith.</p>
                        <p>For, <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchiſedec</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, as Chriſtians do after the Law. But that there might be ſome ſuppreſſion of the over-flowings of ſins in the world, the Law was given; which though it did not quite extinguiſh Sin, yet it reſtrained it much by Terrible Puniſhments; which in the laſt Place Faith utterly took away by moſt comfortable Mercies.</p>
                        <p>Come on therefore, thou Covenant of Grace, and we ſhall be ſaved by thee, that could not be ſaved by the Covenant of the Law. We have an holy boldneſs to appeal from the Throne of Juſtice unto the Mercy-Seat, from Works to Faith, from Law to Goſpel, from Bondage to Liberty, from Death to Life. This is the height of all perfection; Behold I ſhew unto you the moſt excellent way. God demonſtrating his great kindneſs to the Sons of men, he gave grace before more ſparingly, but now moſt largely and generally; full meaſure, preſſed down, and running over, Grace for Grace. This is the Standard of the Lord ſet up upon a hill; Flie to it, all ye Nations, that are heavy laden with the burden of your ſins, and ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls in the Diſpensations of Righteouſneſs, Grace and Glory. Why will ye groan under bondage, and never look out for freedom? Why will ye die, O ye Sons of Men? Come on, let us leave <hi>Moſes</hi> behind us, and follow Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Come, O come to my Soul, thou that art highly beloved of the Father, full of Grace and Truth; and of thy fullneſs we ſhall all receive grace for grace. Come Thou Faireſt of ten thouſand to the <hi>Jew,</hi> labouring under the coſtly Ceremonies, and deadly Injunctions, and relieve him into a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhip, and a lively Commandment: To the <hi>Gentile,</hi> groping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkneſs, and ſtooping under Satan's load, and give light, and put thy eaſie burden upon his ſhoulders. Truſt not, Thou <hi>Jew,</hi> in thy Fleſh,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49664:75"/> and in thy Law, for the Righteouſneſs thereof; but truſt to the Spirit, and to the Goſpel, for the Righteouſneſs thereof. Truſt not, Thou <hi>Gentile,</hi> to thy Arts or Arms; but truſt to the ſaving knowledg, and power of Chriſt, and to the lively Oracles of God. Let both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> come up to a better Rule, approach to a higher Sun; Ye were in <hi>Plato</hi>'s care before, and ſaw nothing but ſhadows; Come forth now into the open Light, and ſee the Beauties of the Subſtances themſelves: See what a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation the Goſpel is. Heretofore a little Grace, and a great deal of wrath; Now all Grace and no Wrath: Heretofore a little Rule, a Law, Form, a Temporal Law of Wrath; Now a vaſt Direction, a high Tribunal, an Eternal Law of Grace: Heretofore Curſing, now Bleſſing: Heretofore Threatnings and Fears, now Promiſes and Hopes: Heretofore a Law that could wound, now a Law that can cure: A Law that could kill, now a Law that can make alive: Never ſuch a Diſpenſation as this! Nothing done by judgments and Fears, but all by Mercies and Love that caſteth out Fears.</p>

                           <p>Yes, CHRIST is the Prieſt, Sacrifice, Temple, Altar, and his Goſpel is the Law for ever. It is a Change for the better; Carnal things for Spiritual, Temporal things for Eternal. <hi>A New Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes.</hi>

                           <p>Chriſt is a Prieſt without beginning or end of daies: The Law of Nature began with nature, and God's worſhip therewith.</p>
                           <p>The Carnal Prieſthood, Worſhip and Law, were Intermedial, Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Typical, and by their intervention there was no interruption of the ſpiritual Prieſthood, Worſhip or Law, which was the ſame for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not perfection, before, under, and after all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. <hi>O the depths of the manifold wiſdom of God! how unſearchable are his waies?</hi>

                        <p>This Doctrine, Converſation, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, opened a wide door of Hope to all Sinners by Repentance to be ſaved from all Sins and Miſeries, and admitted to all happineſs, from which they could not be delivered, and unto which they could not be received, by any other means, or mediation whatſoever.</p>

                        <p>This is the true Converſion and Transforming from the World unto God, from Darkneſs unto his marvellous Light, the Regeneration and new Creation, the putting off of the old Man with the Corruptions and Luſts, and the putting on of the New man, which after Chriſt is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.

                        <p>This was the Day-ſpring from an High, that viſited them that ſate in Darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death, that made the Jew amazed at the inſufficiency of all his Service, and the Gentiles confounded at their vain Philoſophy and Worſhip.

                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49664:82"/>2. Declaration or Nuncupation to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and Heir apparent of all things, and ſole Executor to his Father. This Will I ſay was firſt Nuncupative or by Word of mouth, declaring the full mind of the Teſtatour, as a Will Parol made to Chriſt, the Word and Wiſdom of God, that came from the boſom of the Father, and revealed him. Afterwards it was written by ſome of Chriſt's Apoſtles, and other Divine Perſons, to whom he taught it, on earth and from heaven, as he had received it; and they alſo preached what was revealed unto them, to all the World.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Legacy or Inheritance, which is Bleſſedneſs, and in order thereunto Forgiveneſs of ſins, the Gift of the Spirit, and the Reſurrection of the Body: Which ſaid Bleſſedneſs is a firm Eſtate in Heaven, free from all Evil, and full of all Good, incorruptible, reſerved for us in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Condition: Reſipiſcence, or Holineſs, poſſible and accepted, though not perfect yet made perfect through Chriſt. I ſay poſſible, ſo made by God; or elſe if the Condition had been impoſſible, the Diſpoſition had been void and unjuſt, as all Impoſſible Conditions are, and therefore ſuch Teſtaments are null and void.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Executor, Jeſus Chriſt, who is a Mediatour between God and Man: For every Executor mediates between the Teſtatour and the Legataries, becauſe the Legacies came from the Teſtatour firſt to the Heir or Executor (as we now ſpeak) and by the means of the Executor they are conveyed to the Legataries, who may not take them of their own accord with their own hands, but muſt demand or ſue for them from the hands of the Executor, or otherwiſe they have no power, no right to receive or enjoy them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Legataries inſtituted of God, are All Believers. In all Teſtaments for Pious cauſes, the Legataries are inſtituted by appellative or common and not by their proper Names, for then no Teſtament was able to contain them: As when a Benefactour bequeaths ſuch or ſuch gifts to all the honeſt and laborious Poor in ſuch a Town, all that are honeſt and laborious Poor in that place may challenge their Legacies by virtue of that Deviſe; neither can any of them ſo qualified be excluded or denied their dues.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore to be noted, that this VVill of God is ſuch a Will, and that therein there is no Dereliction or Praeterition at all, but that it is like an Univerſal Pardon, proclaimed to all that will come in and accept thereof upon the Condition expreſſed.</p>

And beſides the reſignation of Bodies to each other, ſo that they are not their own, but have power over each other, they may, and ought, to give their minds and affections mutually, and thereby they are not only one Fleſh, which may be with Harlots, but one Spirit alſo: All which things agree moſt rarely well with the ſpiritual Mariage, which is between Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                           <p>But this Notion is not ſhut out of the Teſtament of God, but comes in very well under it: For we, that are by Faith the Sons and Heirs of God, are alſo his Allies and Friends, yea his Spouſe and Wife, and all the intimate Relations that can be imagined.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Love of Souls.</note>This Love of God to the Soul paſſeth all knowledge to expreſs the height, and length, and depth, and breadth thereof: And again, the Love of the Soul to God is unexpreſſible; <hi>Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of Love.</hi> It is the Soul's raviſhment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to an Extaſie to ſee it ſelf thus beloved of God, and not know how nor why, and to feel what ſhe is not able to conceive or expreſs. The bleſſed Cherubims and Seraphims burn with this Love. But for the deſcription of God's Love, that kindles all other Love, we muſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49664:85"/> draw a Curtain: Silence beſt expreſſes what we are not able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                           <p>The Communion and fellowſhip with God,<note place="margin">Communion.</note> proceeding from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love between God and the Soul, and the influences of the Spirit, is the great myſtery of Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                           <p>Behold what manner of Love this is,<note place="margin">Adoption.</note> that we ſhould be called the Sons of God! And we know that we are now the Sons of God, but we know not hereafter what we ſhall be; but this we know, that when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we ſhall appear with him in glory; and of Carnal be made Spiritual, of Corruptible Incorruptible, of Mortal Immortal.</p>
                           <p>A man may have many Friends very near and dear unto him,<note place="margin">Heir the moſt Beloved.</note> and which may beſtow upon him many and great gifts, and to whom he may give many and great gifts alſo; but the Son and Heir of his Body law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, or the Son and Heir of his Love lawfully adopted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives moſt favour and profit by him, becauſe he is himſelf repreſented and his Off-ſpring forever. So Chriſt is the beloved Son and Heir of God, in whom he is well pleaſed, and in whom we are the beloved Sons, and Heirs and Coheirs with Chriſt. The reſt go away with their ſeveral gifts and honours from him, and ſet up ſeveral houſes and families of their own; but the Son and Heir is full and continual Succeſſor to his Father, in all his Honour and Eſtate, as Lord, Earl, or King, with all the Lands and Revenues for ever entailed upon him by his Father, who thus never dies. But a Wife after her Husband's departure is a Widow, free for another man, loſes a great part of her Luſtre and Priviledges, and enjoys only her Dowry which ſhe had before from her Father, or her Joynture which ſhe received from her Husband; ſo that her Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by her Husbands death is a diminution to her head: But it is the augmentation of an Heir by his Father's deceaſe.</p>
                           <p>And thus God would have it be in the manner of the conveyance of his Eſtate to us, by way of Teſtament, that we ſhould be his Heirs.</p>
                           <p>Thus Love is contained in God's Promiſes, Laws, Conſtitutions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Teſtaments at large, wherein is the Royal Charter of God's great Donation to his Church, and faithful People inſtituted to be his Heirs, and Co-heirs with Chriſt <hi>in toto &amp; ſolido,</hi> every one of them, without any diminution of happineſs though, there be degrees thereof.</p>
                           <p>And under this Grant they claim their Right by their Faith or Promiſe, or Covenant with God to accept of his Love and to obey his Laws. An high honour to be the Friends and Allies of God, but a far higher to be his Sons and Heirs in all Honours and Inheritances entailed, and never to be cut off by God, but only by their own Refuſal or Apoſtacy, elſe the Promiſe of God ſtandeth ſure, and they remain ſpiritual Prophets, Prieſts and Kings for evermore.</p>
                           <p>This is the only difference between earthly and heavenly Heirs, that the Earthly ſucceed in Fleſh and Blood, Honour and Eſtate, and in all things but only Vertues and great Parts; but the Heirs of God ſucceed not only to the Inheritance of Glory, but to the Vertues, Gifts and Graces, and Likeneſs of God.</p>
                           <p>To conclude in a word, there are many and great acts of Grace in the World, but none of them, nor all together, are ſo gracious, as that of a

                        <p>THE Goſpel is the beſt of Teſtaments, as thoſe are amongſt Men, which are made by Fathers to their Children, or by Benefactors to miſerable Perſons, by Free Grace, without any Petition, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation or Merit from themſelves or others: A Teſtament of Grace.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Definition of Grace.</note>Grace therefore is the act of God's Will ſpontaneouſly, or <hi>mero motu,</hi> making us his Sons and Heirs in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                        <p>Here is nothing of Nature, or Merit, or Mediation in the caſe, here is the mere Motion of the Adopter, and unto this to make it complete here is nothing required, but the full and free conſent of the Adopted, to make them as perfect Sons and Heirs by Grace of Adoption, as if they had been made ſo by Nature or Generation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Nature.</note>'Tis Nature makes us Men and Heirs of Earth, but 'tis Grace makes us Chriſtians and Heirs of Heaven: 'Tis Nature makes us the Sons of Men, but 'tis Grace makes us the Sons of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Free Grace.</note>Every Teſtament is an act of Grace; but this is the greateſt Grace that ever was, even Grace for Grace, purely without any motive from the Object to whom it is directed, or from any other for him. It hath its riſe wholly from the Will of the Donor, and not at all from the Will of the Receiver: So God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> It is an independent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Grace ſolely iſſuing from his mere bounty, without all bounds of Law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Right.</note>This with God and Man creates <hi>Jus pingue,</hi> the beſt Right: A Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace to his Children, the Grace of a Patron to his Beneficiary. Such a Grace was fitteſt for God's Grace and Glory; fitteſt for God to give, and for his Children to receive.</p>
                        <p>Nature ſtands at a great diſtance and in a very low ſphere from Grace, for it makes us no more but barely the Sons of Men; that which is born
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49664:87"/> of the Fleſh is but fleſh: but it is Grace only that makes us the Sons of God; for that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Hence Grace is oppoſed to Nature, whereby we are made Men,<note place="margin">Nature.</note> to have an Earthly Inheritance and Dominion after the Image and likeneſs of God, in our Creation; but Grace is that whereby we are made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to an Heavenly Inheritance and Dominion after the Image and likeneſs of Chriſt, who was the Natural Son of God, born to that Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, whereto we after his likeneſs are called by the Grace of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. So God's Grace is oppoſed to Law, not in extremes;<note place="margin">Law.</note> Law gives juſt that good which is due and no more, Grace gives more good than is due, yea, Grace gives good where none at all is due, yea, Grace gives good where evil is due, yea, Grace gives much good when much evil is due. The Law is inexorable and ſpares none, but Grace is eaſie to be entreated and ſpares all: For Grace is a priviledge above Law, rather than extremely contrary to Law. An act of Super-juſtice, rather than contrary to Juſtice: For Mercy rejoyceth and triumpheth over Juſtice, as being the ſpecial and higheſt work of God, in which he moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteh.</p>
                        <p>This is the Trone of Grace, this is the Mercy-Seat,<note place="margin">Throne of Grace.</note> the great Court of Requeſts and of Chancery, <hi>Ubi Jus fit, &amp; Jus datur,</hi> where Rights are made, and where Rights are beſtowed; whereas in other Courts of Law Rights are only declared. Such Courts are much inferior, <hi>Ubi Jus dicitur,</hi> where Rights are declared upon Juſtice, to thoſe higher ones, where they are created and granted upon Mercy and Bounty, and God's Mercies are above all his Works.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. So God's Grace is oppoſed to Wrath in extremes.<note place="margin">Wrath.</note> As Grace gives more good than is due by Law, ſo Wrath gives more evil than is due by Law. And this Wrath God executes by taking the Sword into his own hands, and puniſhing our ſins himſelf beyond the ordinary way of the Law; as Kings by their Prerogatives may do, by Wrath to execute Vengeance more than the bare Law, calls for upon ſome extraordinary offences, on ſome extraordinary occaſions, which they themſelves can beſt judge of; eſpecially when the Inferior Judge is negligent of his duty, in not inflicting the Puniſhment which the Law required; and when ſins have been done with a high hand in open defiance of Rule and Law to the endamagement of the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>Unto this Wrath God's Grace is extremely oppoſed: For when Law and Anger were heavily againſt an obſtinate Sinner, and the Sword of both threatens to devour in an extraordinary way; then ſteps in Mercy and ſtops the Flood-gate of Anger, and ſaves the dying Soul from the Pit of Ruine which was ready to ſwallow him up, becauſe God ſees remorſe in him; though he have been notoriouſly wicked, yet it is the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God for the Glory of his Grace to ſpare, as a Father ſpareth his Son that ſerveth him, to blot out iniquities tranſgreſſions and ſins, and to remember them no more, but that they ſhall be as though they had never been, and now that Soul ſhall live, he ſhall not die.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Works.</note>4. So God's Grace is oppoſed to Works; which are the Merit of the Creature, but this is the Grace of the Creatour. Works deſerve wages, but Eternal life is the gift of God; Grace dignifies a Perſon that deſerves it not. No man can deſerve to be born of his Father, or after he is born, he cannot deſerve to be made the Son and Heir of another man: But the only cauſe of a Son is Love, either by Nature or by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption; and therefore the only cauſe to be made the Son of God, is the Grace of God, not the Works of Man.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Free Grace.</note>Such love of God is the Grace of God, whereby the Receiver is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and profited, and yet he never deſerved it. This is free Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Grace, Ro. 3.24. of Faith, and therefore not of Works, that it might be by Grace only; otherwiſe Grace were no more Grace, and Works were no more Works. This is the Riches of God's Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are accepted in the Beloved. The gift by Grace, the kindneſs and good will of God.</p>
                           <p>This Grace of God is without Cauſe; it is it ſelf the ſupreme and high cauſe, having no other Cauſe above or beyond it to actuate and move it. Nor can any Works ſo much as concur with Grace, becauſe Grace is the ſole Cauſe: For if Salvation were of Works, it ſhould be of Debt, and then it could not be of Grace. They are inconſiſtent and contrary the one to the other;<note place="margin">Ro. 4.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           </p>
                           <p>By this Grace I a poor miſerable Sinner, attainted in the attainder of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and born to temporal and eternal Miſeries, am looked upon with the eye of Mercy to be juſtified from all my Sin and Miſery, and to be inveſted with Holineſs and Happineſs.</p>
                           <p>And the farther Love and Grace of God to me is, that all this ſhould be done in a Teſtamentary way, whereby I ſhould be the more ſure of it: For ſuch an Inſtrument as a Teſtament is requires all the favourable conſtruction that can be imagined, that it may take effect according to the beſt meaning of the Teſtator.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Rich Grace.</note>And ſtill the Exceeding riches of his Grace appears, that he did ſettle this his Teſtament by the Death of Chriſt, who was his own and only Son, whom he ſubſtituted to die in his ſtead: For God could have ſetled his Teſtament by means leſs chargeable, than was the precious Blood of his own Son; but he could not to ſhew the abundance of his Love, who ſo loved the World, as that he ſent his only begotten Son into the ſame, and gave him over unto death, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
                           <p>And laſtly, all this is Grace for Grace, that is, freely and out of mere Grace, and only for the Thanks of the Receiver.</p>

                        <p>Beſides the unqueſtionable Holineſs of his life, and the ſolemnity of his death: Which things were not done in a corner, but in the full view of a greater Congregation than was at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for he preached in their Temple and Synagogues, and did wonders in all <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſuffered death upon Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi>

                           <hi>that before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>he witneſſed a good Confeſſion.</hi> Hence he is called the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful and true Witneſs, the Martyr of the New Teſtament to teſtifie it with his Blood. His death was not only a Teſtimony,<note place="margin">Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but a Confirmation of the New Teſtament; becauſe his death doth wholly, and for ever extinguiſh in him all will or power to revoke it; and evidence, that immediately from that Death God's Teſtament was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> in force, and began to take effect for the Juſtification of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49664:89"/> Mankind, to all the Rights in that Teſtament contained by the Acceſs of their Faith.</p>
                        <p>Thus the immortal God came as near to Death as he could, by the Death of his Son, in his Divine Nature immortal, but made a mortal man to dye in his Father's ſtead, and to demonſtrate his own, and his Father's unconceivable Love, to lay down his Life for Sinners: Which thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a perpetual Commemoration, ſo commanded by Chriſt in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Euchariſt, inſtituted by him for that purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>And as the Soul is alwaies Spirit, but not fully ſanctified, nor fully glorified till after the Bodie's Reſurrection: ſo the Fleſh is alwaies Fleſh, but yet made ſpiritual by Regeneration, but not fully Spiritual till the full Regeneration of Glory after death, which is the ſecond Reſurrection. <hi>For thiis Mortal muſt put on Immortality, and this Corruptible muſt put on Incorruption;</hi> and this Earth muſt put on Heaven, and this Fleſh muſt put on Spirit, and this Terreſtrial muſt be made Coeleſtial; <hi>for as we have born the Image of the Earthly, ſo we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the Heavenly. There are Natural Bodies, and there are Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but firſt that which is Natural, and then that which is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tual.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So, without Death Temporal we cannot be prepared for Life Eternal: For except we fall, we cannot riſe; and except we riſe from the Earth, we cannot aſcend into Heaven; and except we aſcend into Heaven, we cannot enter into the Inheritance of Glory.</p>

                        <p>THE Terms of Liberty are Good and Evil. <hi>Liberty</hi> is a looſneſs from Evil to Good; held by no Evil, and withheld from no Good.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. Receſs from Evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil,<note place="margin">Receſs from Evil.</note> which three are Evils.</p>
                        <p>Remiſſion of ſins is true Liberty from the bonds of Death, Hell, and Satan.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Acceſs to Good.<note place="margin">Acceſs to Good.</note> Good is the proper and principal object of Liberty, the end and ſcope it aims at. When we are hindred from no good, but capable of all, then are we free indeed. As when all <hi>Egypt</hi> lay open to <hi>Joſeph;</hi> when all <hi>Canaan</hi> lay open to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> When the Throne of Grace ſtands wide open, for all that have need, to fly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for Grace ſufficient to help them in the time of all their need. The firſt is a Vulgar Liberty, ſuch as the Poor and Strangers have; the ſecond is a Royal Liberty for Children and free Denizens.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon is from the affinity it hath with Repentance. <label type="milestone">

                           </label> Liberty is a preparative to Repentance: Till the Soul be looſe from Evil, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turn unto God. As Repentance is a turning from ſin to God, ſo Liberty is a turning from Evil to Good. As in Repentance, the Right turning is from Evil to Good, or elſe it is Apoſtacy: ſo in Liberty, the Right turning is from Evil to Good, or elſe it is Licentiouſneſs. So looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Law is ſlavery: To be free from Righteouſneſs is to be the Servant of ſin.</p>

                        <p>The proper End of Man is Happineſs: Reſtraint from that makes ſlavery or true Miſery. When we are free from Worldly ends of Honour, &amp;c. and clearly looſe to heaven and heavenly things then are we free indeed.</p>
                        <p>As Baſtardy bars from a temporal Inheritance. As Infamy bars from temporal Honour: ſo Liberty admits to Eternal Felicity. As Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Temporal Honours makes a Freeman, ſo much more Capacity to Eternal Honours.</p>

                        <p>A Man's Proper Guide is a Right Spirit. As a Reſtraint from that is ſlavery: ſo a Looſneſs to that is Liberty.</p>
                        <p>All other Guides, as Satan, World, Paſſions of fleſh, are Troublers rather than Leaders; but when we are free from all theſe, then are we free indeed.<note place="margin">Philo. 2 Cor. 3. pen.</note> 
                           <hi>Revera liber eſt qui ſolum Deum ſequitur,</hi> He is free indeed that follows God only. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.</hi> Hence that great Queſtion,<note place="margin">☞</note> how Free-will can conſiſt with God's Grace, is eaſily decided; for where God's Grace works upon the Will, the more it works upon the Will to draw it, and the more the Will conforms to God's Grace to follow it, the more Free the Will is.</p>
                        <p>Grace then doth not deſtroy nor aboliſh Liberty, but beget and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it; for the more God's Grace doth looſe the Will from evil, and lead it on to good, the more it frees the Will: And as till then the Will is not free, ſo then it is moſt free.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49664:96"/> as a Chriſtian. He is free that can act his own Will, <hi>i. e.</hi> after Reſolution is not hindred from acting it, nor forced to act the contrary. Thus God doth act his own VVill, and the Angels and glorified Saints act their own VVills; and this is Liberty.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. A Looſneſs of Man to his Proper Rule, is Liberty.<note place="margin">Looſneſs to proper Rule.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Proper Rule of Man is the Law. As a Reſtraint from that is Slavery, ſo a Looſneſs to it is Liberty.</p>
                        <p>All other Rules, as the Wiſdom of the Fleſh and the World, are ſtrong, and impediments: When thou art clear from theſe, and looſe to live by the Law,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.15.</note> then thou art free to walk according to the <hi>perfect Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> Not that the Law leaves us to our Liberty whether to keep it or no, much leſs gives Liberty to tranſgreſs it; but becauſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of it argues Liberty, freely to run in the waies of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
                        <p>The Law, not Conſcience is the Soveraign Rule of Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> God's Law, or Man's Law where no Law of God declares it unlawful; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt have a Guide, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Law to rule it, or elſe it is unruly: For where there is no Law, there is no Conſcience, ſeeing Conſcience is but the dictate of the Law of Equity, which is a Law preſcribing to the Law of Juſtice, and over-ruling it. And Conſcience pretended is but blindneſs of mind, or hardneſs of heart, unleſs it can ſee or feel it ſelf in ſome Law.</p>
                        <p>Therefore for a Man to be reſtrained from his proper Rule, that he cannot or may not live by the Law, but forced to live without or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law only at the will and pleaſure of another, is ſlavery; but the contrary is true Liberty.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Proper State of a Man is to be a perſon after God's own Image. And as a Reſtraint from that makes Slavery: ſo a Looſneſs to it is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                        <p>All other States, as of Sin and Corruption, are exotick and forreign, heterogeneous and troubleſom; but when none of the Manacles reſtrain the Spirit, there is Freedom.</p>
                        <p>Hence Natural Corruption is a ſtate of Slavery, becauſe it dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorates and depraves thy proper Perſon, diminiſheth thy head, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces God's Image in thee: But thy Spiritual Regeneration is a ſtate of Liberty, becauſe it meliorates, advances thy head, and reſtores thee to the New Man after God and Chriſt, in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. And that Spirit of God that doth Regenerate, doth thereby adopt, and therefore Enfranchiſe, <hi>For if Children, then free;</hi> the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is contrary to the Spirit of Bondage, and <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life makes us free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> The ſtate of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude is Death, for Slaves, as Dead men, have no Will, no more than Beaſts to act any thing in Law.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. From the nature of Liberty.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt was looſe from all Evil, impeccant and impeccable, our High Prieſt, <hi>ergo</hi> holy and harmleſs; our High-Sacrifice, <hi>ergo</hi> pure and ſpotleſs, looſe from all miſery, though he ſuffered much, yet he ſuffered it freely, he dyed, but freely: <hi>He laid down his life, it was in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take it up,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note> 
                              <hi>and to lay it down</hi> No man gave it to him, nor took it from him, and he laid it down but for three days, and then took it again.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe Chriſt was looſe unto all good, looſe to his proper end, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs: Chriſt was not <hi>viator,</hi> but <hi>comprehenſor;</hi> no Expectant, but in Poſſeſſion; no Candidate for, but actually inſtalled in the Throne of Glory. Chriſt was perſonally united unto God, and the fulneſs of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49664:99"/> Godhead dwelt in him bodily: Chriſt is naturally free, not made free, but makes others free, free by Nature born, not by Grace given.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſt is the Son of God. The immediate property of a Son is freedom. <hi>Liberi</hi> ſignifie Children and Free-men. Sons are Heirs, and all Heirs are Free, though Slaves before. Chriſt is Heir to his Father, <hi>Ergo</hi> to all his Father's Rights, <hi>Ergo</hi> to Liberty. If therefore Liberty be the Right of God the Father, then God the Son ſtands in ſucceſſion to the ſame Right.</p>

                           <p>The Church is the free Kingdom and City of God, Saints and Angels are fellow Citizens, all partakers of the ſame Coeleſtial freedom.

                           <p>To this ſtate of Son-hood are conſequent two Rights:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Of Maintenance; to be nouriſhed and educated as the Sons of God by the Spirit of God, called the Comforter.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>For though God be free to Adopt whom he will to be his Sons, yet after Adoption, he is bound by the Law of Adoption to juſtifie them, or give them a Right to Maintenance, and then to a Right of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe by the Law of Nature both theſe are due to the Native Son, therefore by the Law of Adoption they are due alſo to the Adoptive Son.</p>
                           <p>But in this Term of Acceſs, there is no difference between the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtian, but both are equally the Sons of God in equal Right to Maintenance and Inheritance. No difference of Perſons with God, <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> Bond or Free, Male or Female, all are alike to him.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe the Manumiſſion of the <hi>Jew</hi> from being a Servant, and the Deniſation of the <hi>Gentile</hi> from being an Alien, concur into one and the ſame ſtate of Chriſtian Liberty. The Author whereof is God, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Collator, Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. In all this Chriſtian Liberty it is to be noted, that there is a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Rigor, Bondage, and Curſe of the Law, but not from the Rule of the Law of God, which is the Light of Nature and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Light of Grace in the Scripture, and from the Laws of Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them both; it being the Nature of true Liberty alwaies to conſiſt with true Obedience to Laws, and the more obedient, the more free, for the Service of God is perfect freedom: And when we are free only to good without Indifferency, then are we in the true reſemblance of God and Angels, who will Good only without all reluctancy or inclination to Evil.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In this Chriſtian Liberty alſo it is to be noted, that God's free Grace and Man's free Will, do very excellently well conſiſt together: And the more Man's free Will follows God's free Grace, the more free it is; becauſe God's free Grace doth free the Will by looſing it from all Evil, and leading it into all Good. In which condition, when the Will is ſo fixed, without hovering to and fro (trembling, as the Needle in the Compaſs) but freely and undoubtingly pointing in its firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God and all Goodneſs, then is our Abſolute Perfection come upon us, which we aſpire unto in this life.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, till we attain to this full Freedom (as they that ſearch for the Philoſopher's Stone, which though they find not, yet they diſcover excellent Rarities ſo) we meet with admirable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of breaking through the revocations of a ſenſitive Will, in the tendencies of the Rational deſire to the Coeleſtial Objects of Love</p>
                           <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49664:100"/>
                           <p>Moſt things have their Counterfeits, and whatſoever is in deed, may be in outward ſhew. As there is Chriſtianity in deed, and in ſhew: ſo there is Liberty in truth, and Liberty in appearance; Slavery in truth, and Slavery in appearance.</p>
                           <p>And theſe Counterfeits, that would ſeem to be the ſame with the Real, are quite Contraries. As the Devil appears to be an Angel of Light, but is the Prince of Darkneſs: ſo Licentiouſneſs would be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty, but is Antichriſtian Bondage.</p>
                           <p>The True Freedom is from the Son of God, and the True Slavery is from the Devil.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Iſaac.</note>II. <hi>Iſaac</hi> the youngeſt Son was by a Free-woman, his Legitimate Son by a lawful Wife.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>Sarah</hi> was Free-born, and lived free a Matron, had the true Right of Bed and Board, of Dower and Power, dignity of Rule under <hi>Abraham</hi> over the Family: For, <hi>Liber eſt qui Jus habet ſui ipſius, Servus qui nullum Jus habet, ſed eſt alterius,</hi> He or ſhe is free that hath Right, but a Servant hath none, but is another man's Right.</p>
                           <p>And as the two Mothers Conditions were contrary one to another, ſo were their two Sons: For <hi>Partus ſequitur ventrem;</hi> the one therefore was a Bond-man as his Mother was a Bond-woman, and the other a Free-man as his Mother was a Free-woman. The one therefore had no Right to the Inheritance, becauſe he was no Right Son, but a Baſtard; and the other had Right, becauſe he was a True Son and Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
                           <p>So the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are contrary the one to another, becauſe their ſtates and conditions are contrary. The Law is a Bond-woman, and the Goſpel is a Free-woman; and the Sons of the Law and of the Goſpel follow the ſtate and condition of their Mothers, for the Sons of the Law are as <hi>Iſmael,</hi> who though a Son, had neither the ſtate of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the Right of a Son, but was a Baſtard and Bond-child, becauſe he came from a Woman, who had not the ſtate of a Woman nor the Right of a Wife, but was a Bond-maid and a Concubine: And the Sons of the Goſpel are as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was a True Son, and had the State of the Perſon and the Right of a Son, becauſe he came from a Woman who had the ſtate of a Woman and the Right of a Wife, and was no Bond-woman nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine.</p>
                           <p>So it is plain from this way of Argumentation uſed by the Apoſtle, That the Sons of the Law, that truſt to the Law only, ſhall be as little juſtified, or have as little Right to the Inheritance of heaven, as <hi>Iſmael</hi> had to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Inheritance, which was none at all; becauſe he was born of a Woman who had Works enough, for ſhe was a Bond-maid, but thoſe could create unto her no Right, nor to her Son to inherit. But the Sons of the Goſpel, that truſt to the Goſpel only, ſhall be thereby as much juſtified, and have as much right to the Inheritance of heaven, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> had to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Inheritance, which mas a complete Right; becauſe he was born of a Woman, who had Faith to conceive when paſt Child-bearing, which did create to her a full Right to be a Mother, and to her Son to be an Heir.</p>
                           <p>This was the firſt Difference between the two Mothers and the two Sons on the Mother's ſide.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Difference is between the two Sons only by the Father's ſide.</p>
                           <p>For though they had one and the ſame Father, yet they were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from different principles and operations in <hi>Abraham,</hi> enabling him to beget them.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <note place="margin">Gen. 16.2.</note>1. <hi>Iſmael</hi> came from <hi>Abraham</hi> as from a natural Father, <hi>born after the fleſh,</hi> by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural power and ſtrength of Generation, as alſo from <hi>Agar's</hi> natural force of Conception.</p>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:49664:101"/>
                           <p>For <hi>Abraham</hi> was not reſtrained by Nature from begetting, being then but eighty five years old; though <hi>Sarah</hi> was reſtrained from bearing, though not by Nature, as being the younger, yet by God's will.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſaac</hi> came from <hi>Abraham</hi> as from a ſupernatural Father, born after the Spirit by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſupernatural power and ſtrength of Generation from God, as alſo from <hi>Sarah's</hi> ſupernatural virtue of Conception by God.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>Abraham</hi> was reſtrained by Nature from begetting,<note place="margin">Ro. 10.7.</note> being then Ninety nine years old, and <hi>Sarah</hi> had a double deadneſs, for beſides that ſhe was barren, ſhe was Ninety years old, yet conceived by virtue of God's Promiſe,<note place="margin">Ro. 9.8, 9.</note> or by the Spirit and power of God upon her Faith.</p>
                           <p>So they that will be under the Law, which is a Bond-woman, and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to Bondage, though thereby they be the Children of God, yet they are but his natural and carnal Children, becauſe born after a more natural and carnal way by Works under the Law,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> conſiſting in carnal and fleſhly Ordinances.</p>
                           <p>But they that are under Grace, or under the Goſpel which is a Free-woman, and engendring to Liberty, they are the True Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sons of God, becauſe they are born after a more ſupernatural and Spiritual way by Faith under the Goſpel, conſiſting of Spiritual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
                           <p>Thus <hi>that which is born of the</hi> Law or <hi>Fleſh is fleſh,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Joh. 3.3.</note> according to the nature of the Law; <hi>but that which is born of the</hi> Goſpel or <hi>Spirit is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> according to the nature of the Goſpel.

                           <p>So the Seat of the Goſpel is above, whence it was delivered to Chriſt, and from whence Chriſt brought it to the World below.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Effect of the Goſpel is Liberty engendred thereby.</p>
                           <p>For according to the Nature of the Goſpel, ſo are the Spirits and Manners of Men under it.</p>
                           <p>The Goſpel of Chriſt is eaſie and light for its Rites, which are but two, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; and for its Precepts, and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Threatnings, pure, ſpiritual and eternal. And therefore it begets a Spirit or Genius correſpondent to it ſelf, of Son-like Diligence, and filial Love, under a kind and tender Mother.</p>
                           <p>The Mothers differ: ſo do the Children.</p>
                           <p>The Children reſemble their ſeveral Mothers.</p>
                           <p>The Children of their ſeveral Mothers reſemble one another, and are all in a like ſtate of the ſame Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The Children of the Law are chiefly for the Letter: The Children of the Goſpel are chiefly for the Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The Children of the Law are chiefly for Temporals: The Children of the Goſpel are chiefly for Eternals.</p>
                           <p>The Children of the Law know darkly, and underſtand Spiritual and Eternal things afar off: The Children of the Goſpel know clearly, and underſtand Spiritual and Eternal things as near at hand; <hi>Faith being the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Children of the Law are in their Minority, not only in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.1, &amp;c.</note> but in their Servants power, <hi>under Tutors and Governours</hi> as Servants, though they be Lords of all: But the Children of the Goſpel are in their Majority, Adult and Manumitted.</p>
                           <p>They that are under the Law are as a Wife under the Dominion and Power of her Husband: But they that are under the Goſpel are as a Wife <hi>whoſe Husband is dead,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ro. 7.1, &amp;c.</note> and therefore looſe from the hard Law of a ſevere Husband, <hi>and is now married to another</hi> more gentle and generous Husband, under whom ſhe enjoys a noble Freedom.</p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:49664:102"/>
                           <p>The Law is the Mother of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and all that obſerve that Rule; but the Goſpel is the Mother of all Nations for Grace, Mercy and Peace to them and to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Poſterity was double to <hi>Iſmael's.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The firſt Covenant of the Law laſted but for a time, but the ſecond Covenant of the Goſpel endures for ever.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Iſmael</hi> Perſecuted <hi>Iſaac.</hi> He that was born after the Fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit. The <hi>Jew</hi> Perſecuted, and ſtill the Carnal <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtian perſecutes the Spiritual Chriſtian indeed.</p>
                           <p>But as the Son of the Bond-woman was caſt out with his Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould not inherit with the Son of the Free-woman: ſo the Son of the freedom is kept in and abides in the houſe of God for ever with his Mother, to inherit the Kingdom of the Father, unto which they of the Law cannot be juſtified by their works, but they of the Law by Faith only. So then, we that are of Faith are not the Children of the Bond-woman, but of the Free, and conſequently are not under the Law, but under Grace.</p>

                           <p>By all this we are taught the Excellent ſtate of Chriſtian Liberty;<note place="margin">State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty.</note> by which,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jews</hi> are redeemed from the Ordinances of Policy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which was a bondage, ſuch as neither they nor their Fore-fathers were able to bear.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> are redeemed from Idolatry under the kingdom of Satan to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were Children and Servants in their Minority: The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were Aliens and Strangers from God. Both are made the Sons of God adoptive by Grace.</p>
                           <p>Great Miſtakes there are in the World about this Liberty.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Papiſts have quite loſt it. They have no liberty to uſe their own Judgments, but are captivated in all things.</p>
                           <p>By the Infallibility and Supremacy of the Pope.</p>
                           <p>By an abſolute Dictatorſhip of every Caſuiſt or Confeſſor, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ignorant, to impoſe upon them that have more Learning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than themſelves, if they would dare to uſe it.</p>
                           <p>The ſlavery of the Soul is the greateſt of all others. I do not wonder at the Ignorant People, becauſe they never knew better things; but I wonder at wiſe men that might know better, and doubtleſs do.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Papiſts have no Liberty of Practice.</p>
                           <p>No Liberty to read the Scriptures.</p>
                           <p>No Liberty to underſtand their own Prayers.</p>

                           <p>I had rather be chained at an Oar, and tug in a Gally, or dig in a Mine, or draw in a Wagon like a Horſe and be free in my Soul, than to be a

                           <p>A Pope or Councel, or perhaps an Ignorant Frier ſhall domineer over my Conſcience, and impoſe upon my Faith, or make me go bare-foot or bare-leg, or Whip my ſelf, or kiſs a rotten Relique of a dead man's Bone, or an Old-ſhoe.</p>
                           <p>Kings have been trod upon, or made to hold Stirrups, or kiſs the feet of Popes.</p>

                           <p>Are allowed Liberty of Judgments, and Liberty of Practice in ſafe things.</p>
                           <p>They have the Scriptures to uſe.</p>
                           <p>They have Prayers in a known Tongue.</p>
                           <p>They have Liberty to eat and drink.</p>
                           <p>The Clergy may marry.</p>
                           <p>All have Liberty to go to God directly, not to Saints or Angels at all.</p>
                           <p>They have Liberty of the Sacrament.</p>
                           <p>They have Liberty for Time.</p>
                           <p>They have Liberty of Eſtate.</p>

                           <p>But after ſeventy years Captivity, that ſore and laſting Calamity for all their Idolatries, they began to come to their Wits, arriving at ſome degree of maturity and growth: The Temple ſo deſtroyed, and now ſo proudly re-edified, and their Enemies ſtill increaſing upon them, and God withdrawing his viſible preſence from them by little and little, and no Angel nor Prophet appearing to comfort them, they were taught that there was ſome higher Worſhip, and more Spiritual happineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them, than the Law did promſe: And they began by degrees to elevate their minds to ſeek him in his proper dwelling place of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to rely upon Coeleſtial and Eternal Promiſes, as appeared by the conſtancy of their Sufferings under <hi>Antiochus</hi> even to Martyrdom in the Hope that their Fathers the beſt of them had, <hi>That they might obtain a better Reſurrection.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 11.35.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus their Affections were weaned by degrees, towards the dawning of the Goſpel, and the Day-ſpring from on high which was ſhortly to viſit them. All hopes of Temporal happineſs failing them, being put under the <hi>Roman</hi>-yoke alſo which they ſo much abhorred, the Wiſeſt among them did look up higher than this World, and waited for the greater Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who was to be the Hopes of all the ends of the Earth.</p>
                           <p>The Glory of the Scepter being at laſt departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> firſt raviſhed from them by one of the Limbs of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Lion, and afterwards graſped by the Talons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle; after this deadly gripe the Royal Stock was quite extinct, and the Office of <hi>Aaron</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and all things in Church and State ſo blended contrary to their Original Inſtitution, that they were at their wits end, as to any Temporal recovery, which made the Underſtanding Party look up higher; but the Generality were ſorely abuſed by their Leaders and Teachers.</p>
                           <p>Then came <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> the Preacher of Repentance to the Poor people, and to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> that generation of Vipers, warning them to flee from the Wrath, and to embrace the Mercy, that was to come; and to bring forth fruits worthy of Repentance, and not to ſay any more in their hearts, That they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, for God was able out of the Stones to raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> not to truſt in the Temple, for not a ſtone ſhall be left upon a ſtone;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49664:104"/> and the Axe was laid to the Root of the Tree, and every Tree that brought not forth good fruit was to be hewn down and caſt into the fire. Alſo Chriſt was to come with his Fann in his hand, who would throughly purge his floor, and gather his Wheat into his Garner, and burn up the Chaff with unquenchable fire. And except men were born again, and except their Righteouſneſs did exceed the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they ſhould never enter into the Kingdom of heaven; but muſt be baptized, not with VVater, but with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire. Many mighty Miracles were done by Jeſus Chriſt and his Diſciples in all the Regions round about, ſo as it was never heard of or ſeen before ſince the VVorld ſtood. At this hearing and ſeeing of theſe VVonders the People were amazed, and all ſorts began to enquire, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we do?

                           </p>
                           <p>Thus was the way of the Lord prepared, and his paths made ſtreight; <hi>Every Valley was exalted, and every Mountain and Hill brought low,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Luk. 3.5, &amp;c.</note>

                           <p>So the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was in its Minority under the Law, as under a School maſter, which taught them Elements, and gave them Corrections, <hi>i. e.</hi> Elements of civil Converſation with others, and ſobriety in their own perſons, Principles of Morality, as forbidding of Murther, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Theft, &amp;c. ſitting them thereby for the prohibition of Anger, Malice, Luſt, &amp;c. in the New Law of Chriſt, who ſaith,<note place="margin">Math. 5.28.</note>

                              <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> after the Creation having received a Law from God, began quickly to aſpire to be Gods themſelvss, and hearkned to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the Devil in hopes of greater Knowledge and Immortality, and they ſtooped ſo low, that even Senſual pleaſures of Sight and Taſte drew down their noble Souls, contrary to their own Reaſon and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, not enduring to be reſtrained by his Power, though it were but to one forbidden Tree, when they had the Liberty of the whole World beſide. But alas! they ſoon ſaw their Error, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and were pardoned by the Grace of God, through the Seed of the Woman, from whence the Tranſgreſſion firſt ſprung, breaking the Serpents head that tempted her thereunto.</p>

                           <p>Then did they teach their Children to fear that God, whom they had offended, and by whom they were ſo gratiouſly pardoned. But the very Firſt-born <hi>Cain</hi> rebelled, and his Poſterity took after him, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sons of Men; but <hi>Seth</hi> and his Race trod in the ſteps of their Father, and were called the Sons of God.</p>

                           <p>This was the way which God took to deal with that ſtupid and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation. And not only with thoſe profeſt Idolaters, that forſook that God that gave Teſtimony all that while of his Goodneſs, <hi>in giving them Rain from Heaven, and Fruitful Seaſons,</hi>

                           <p>Therefore God ſent them Angels ſometimes in the ſhapes of Men, and ſometimes Prophets working Divine miracles: Sometimes he afforded them viſible Teſtimonies of his Preſence, by Clouds and Fire, and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings and Lightnings, and a Mountain burning and quaking, and the ſound of a Trumpet, and the Voice of God: In the Wilderneſs, a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Tabernacle; in <hi>Canaan,</hi> a ſtanding Temple, with Altars, Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, and a Mercy-Seat; a Fire that came down from heaven, conſtantly burning; a Table of Shew-bread, the Ark of the Covenant, the Oracle of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Beſides his favourable Preſence with them, he manifeſted his nearneſs to puniſh them, by thoſe apparent Judgments of breaking upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Offenders, upon whole Armies and Nations, by Fire from heaven,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49664:107"/> by Plagues, and Famines, &amp;c. and foretelling their dreadful Ruines by prodigious Signs in the Heavens.</p>
                           <p>This was all along the manner of God's Diſpenſations in thoſe daies, by Threatnings of Judgments, and Promiſes of Bleſſings, ſo to lead and drive that groſs, dull, and ſtiff-necked Generation, who would be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by no other Arguments, that God was preſent among them, nor be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by any other inducements from their corrupt Manners which they had contracted in that Sink of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and even in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from the Abominations of all the Nations that were round about them.</p>
                           <p>But when the Fulneſs of Time, and the Adult age of the Church was come, then did Chriſt the Son of God viſit them from heaven, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe coming they had neither Angel nor Prophet to work any Sign or Wonder, or to comfort them at all, to teach them the more to long for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the great Angel of the Covenant, and the great Prophet of God, who taught them a higher Law, and did greater Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets; and after he had ſhewed them his laſt Sign of Riſing from the dead, and had given power to his Apoſtles to work Wonders; when they left the World, he ſent no more Angels nor Prophets, nor did no more Signs or Wonders, nor left no more Oracles, but the Scriptures and minds of the Faithful enlightned by his Spirit, to lead them into all Truth, and to be with them to the end of the World.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we may not expect any Angel or Prophet, nor any Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings or Lightnings, Sword, Famine or Peſtilence, Peace, Plenty, Health or Proſperity, particular or general Judgments, or ſignal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, upon any ſuch account as formerly, to manifeſt thereby God's ſpecial favour or wrath to particular Perſons, or Nations in general, as to their Spiritual or Eternal condition. For God goes another way to work, more free, eaſie, natural, and rational to the Souls of men, and made ſweetly convincing and attracting to a more ſublime and holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuitable and pleaſing to the Majeſty of Heaven; and therefore we are not to be frighted by Judgments, nor allured by Proſperities into Religion, as Children, but informed, convinced and perſwaded like men, by ſound reaſon and underſtanding, through any good or bad condition in this life, unto the hopes of a glorious and bleſſed Immortality.</p>
                           <p>It becometh not Chriſtians adult, that know their Fathers Will, to be in fear and bondage all their life long, becauſe of temporal Plagues, nor to be raviſhed with temporal Joys; but to live above them all, by faith and not by ſight, as Pilgrims and Strangers here, declaring by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that <hi>they have no abiding City below, but that they ſeek one that is above, whoſe builder and maker is God, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi>

                        <p>God gave the inheritance of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> immediately by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but the Law that was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made, was delivered by the ordination of Angels, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe Law was a Terror, but the Inheritance was a matter of Grace; As is the manner of great Princes to beſtow their Graces and Favours by themſelves, but to execute matter of Law and Juſtice by their Officers and Judges. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Receiver of the Law from the Angels, and the Repeater of it to the People, three daies together for the Commandments thereof; but the Judgments were publiſhed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> only upon the Peoples requeſt, becauſe of the terror of the Angels voice, who firſt wrote them in a Book, and afterward read them openly to all the Congregation.</p>

                        <p>Whereas it is ſaid, that the Commandments were delivered by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is as much as to ſay, by his <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> becauſe the Hand is the greateſt Inſtrument of working:<note place="margin">Exod. 32.15. and 34.29.</note> So the two Tables are ſaid to be written by the Finger of God, and were delivered into <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hand.

                           <hi>and contrary unto us, was nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> So they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediator of the firſt Teſtament, and cancelled by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator of the ſecond Teſtament: For finding fault with them, he ſaith, <hi>Behold the daies come, ſaith the Lord,</hi>

                        <p>The firſt Teſtament therefore being made void by the death of Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> is no longer a Mediator of that which is not; but the New and and laſt Teſtament ſucceeding in the room of the firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is become the Mediator thereof.

                           <p>Thus God and Man are each others Father and Son, Man the Son and Father of God, and God the Father and Son of Man.</p>
                           <p>By two of theſe four Generations our Saviour was a Son, <hi>viz.</hi> by the firſt and the laſt.</p>
                           <p>When God broughth forth God, Chriſt was the Son of God. And</p>
                           <p>When Man brought forth God, Chriſt was the Son of Man.</p>
                           <p>So Chriſt is the <hi>Firſt and the Laſt;</hi> the Firſt, Son of God,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.17.</note> and the Laſt, Son of Man: The Firſt by whom Man had his beginning, and the Laſt in whom he hath his ending. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi>

                           <p>Note, that though our Saviour had theſe two Births and two Fathers; yet he is not two Sons, no more than he that hath two Sons is two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</p>

                           <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe theſe two Births had but one Perſon to ſuſtain them; for the Perſon of the Godhead ſupported both. <hi>The Fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily.</hi>

                           <p>When we would alter any thing from ſome Quality that it hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to a more noble nature, we apply it to an Agent, which actually enjoyeth that noble form which we deſire ſhould be transferred to our matter. As when one would induce the quality of heat into Water,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49664:112"/> we oppoſe it to the Fire, which hath that innate quality more noble than any other thing: ſo Man being to be made the Son of God, it was fitteſt that the Son of God ſhould qualifie him for that dignity; becauſe the Son of God hath that Prerogative already, and on whomſoever he works, he muſt needs transform them to the Sons of God: As the Fire turns all things to its ſelf.</p>
                           <p>God being beſt pleaſed with his own Son, might beſt by him become pleaſed with Man; for who could better convey God's Love, than the Son who was God's beſt beloved?</p>

If my Picture be like me, then am I like my Picture; and it is more than like, it is the very ſame: Man is as verily the Son of God, as the Son of God is very Man.

                        <p>For by the Civil Law Teſtament and Teſtator do commonly concur in one and the ſame Perſon, yet not neceſſarily but accidentally:<note place="margin">Mediator and Teſtator how concurring.</note> For when a witneſs ſhall teſtifie upon his Death the verity and certainty of another man's Will and Teſtament; ſuch an one, though he be not the Author, yet he may be called the Teſtator to that Teſtament: And by his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to inſinuate and prove that Teſtament ſo far, as by his Death he is both a Mediator and Teſtator of that Teſtament: ſo that a Mediator and Teſtator, in reſpect of the ſame Teſtament, are not functions inconſiſtent and incompatible, but may eaſily, though not uſually, concur in the ſame Perſon.</p>
                        <p>But this of Chriſt his Confirmation of his Father's Teſtament, is an act extraordinary (as may be amongſt ſome men by Priviledge) becauſe of his Subſtitution to die in God's ſtead, that could not die, to Confirm that Teſtament of God, whereof he was Mediator and Heir; and therein to confirm God's League or Covenant with Mankind, whereof he was the Agitator and Mediator alſo.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt therefore may be called the Teſtator, though he was not the Author of the New Teſtament, becauſe he was the main Inſtrument and VVitneſs to ſpread it in his Father's Name, who appointed him to die in his ſtead: For we commonly attribute the ſame Action both to the Agent, who is the pure Cauſe of it, and to the Inſtrument, who is the Means of it.</p>
                        <p>But really and truly, what is done by the order and appointment of another, is done by him that appointed him; as in Acts of Proxies,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49664:114"/> Deputies, Vicegerents, and Procurators or Attorneys of all ſorts, as to Marriages, Livery and Seiſin, Inſtalments, Inductions, &amp;c. For it is a moſt true Rule in Law, <hi>Quod quis facit per alium videtur facere per ſe:</hi> VVhat a man does by another it is his own Act and Deed. So God is the Teſtator, and Chriſt is in God's ſtead, as his Deputy and Vicegerent in the place of his Father, in that ſenſe is the Teſtator alſo.</p>

                           <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Brethren, that he might be a Merciful and Faithful High-Prieſt to make reconciliation for the Sins of the People: For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi>

And no Man taketh this honour to himſelf, but he that is called of God as was</hi> Aaron: <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High-Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</hi>

Becauſe he is Man, in all things like unto Man, Sin only excepted, and therefore ordained and ſeparated from other men; and moſt holy, that we might be made holy; and therefore Compaſſionate of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Men, as of their Ignorances and Errors, not only in reſpect of Fact but of Law alſo, becauſe of weak capacities, and ſlippery me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and weak performances; having reſpect to their Wills, which, if earneſt, and honeſt to do what they can, ſhall be accepted according to what abilities of knowledge, and remembrance, and doing they have, and not according to what they have not.</p>
                        <p>As Man alſo he is compaſſed with Infirmity. The Infirmity of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal High-Prieſt, as of all men, was Sin, and therefore might and did fall into Ignorances and Errors, frail Actions like other men: But Chriſt's Infirmity is his Sufferings, and not his Sin; for he knew not ſin.</p>
                        <p>He was ſubject to Afflictions and Trials as other men. The Legal High-Prieſt therefore was fain to offer often for his own Infirmities, in falling into Ignorance, and Error, and frail Actions often; as alſo for the frequent failings of the People much more, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.6, &amp;c. So Chriſt <hi>in the daies of his Fleſh,</hi> Heb. 5.7. which is the ſubject of his Infirmity and Sufferings, <hi>offered up for himſelf Prayers and Supplications unto him that was able to ſave him from death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Chriſt in his Agony chiefly requeſted, to have <hi>that bitter Cup removed from him:</hi> And when he was upon the Croſs, he lamentably complained, ſaying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> He prayed therefore, that, becauſe he muſt die, he might be delivered from death; and therefore in dying commended his Spirit to God, to receive it into his hands, and keep it for him, and reſtore it to him, who would not leave his Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer his Holy One to ſee Corruption. And theſe were ſtrong Cries, accompanied with many Tears, in ſo great extremities.</p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:49664:115"/>
                        <p>Seeing then that Chriſt was exerciſed with the experience of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Pains, he cannot but be moved at the Miſeries and Pains of his Servants, and muſt needs readily bow down his ear to hear their doleful Cries, and ſtretch out his hand to ſave them, before the Pit of ruine ſhut her mouth upon them.</p>
                        <p>Thus did Chriſt offer his Prayers for himſelf, while he was on Earth,<note place="margin">Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Self.</note> that he might ſave himſelf from death; for when he was reſtored to life, and had ſo overcome Death as to die no more, He then being in heaven, offered himſelf immaculate and immortal, as he was; not for himſelf as before, when he bore our Sins and carried our Sorrows, for he hath no need to offer for himſelf there.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt therefore offered up his Prayers on Earth for himſelf, but he offered up himſelf in Heaven for us. For himſelf he offered, when he was mortal in the daies of his Fleſh; for us he offered, when he was an immortal and eternal Spirit.</p>
                        <p>And in all his Prayers our great High-Prieſt is heard; firſt for himſelf on Earth, that he might be ſaved from the Death which he feared, that is, out of Death unto Eternal life: and ſecondly for us in Heaven, that we might be ſaved from the power of Death, and brought to Eternal life, as he was.</p>
                        <p>In the daies of his Fleſh Chriſt was not yet perfect, had not finiſhed his work, was not gone to his Father; but when he had overcome Death, and Aſcended into Heaven, and ſat on the Throne of the Majeſty on high, he being made perfect through Sufferings, became the Author and Miniſter of Eternal Salvation. Then was he fully inveſted and inſtalled into his Royal Prieſthood; there he preſented himſelf to God for us, in the Temple of God eternal in the Heavens.</p>

And this did even <hi>Abraham</hi> do, ſo great a Man, ſo great a Patriarch, yea, the Prince of Patriarchs, the very Root and foundation of God's People.</p>
                           <p>Now he that receiveth Tithes is greater than he that give them, as he that receiveth Tribute or Taxes is greater than he that paies them; and he that receiveth Rents is greater than he that paies them.</p>
                           <p>This was the Dignity and Prerogative of the Title of <hi>Levi,</hi> that all the other Tribes, who, though his Brethren, yet were to pay Tithes of all to him, and in ſpecial to the Prieſts of the Line of <hi>Aaron</hi> that came from him; which Family only had right to the Prieſthood,<note place="margin">Numb. 3.</note> and the reſt of that Tribe did miniſter unto them in and about the Holy things of the Ark and Temple of the Lord.<note place="margin">Numb. 18.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>And firſt the People muſt give Tithes to the <hi>Levites,</hi> Numb. 18.21. then the <hi>Levites</hi> muſt give Tithes of their Tithes to the Prieſts, Numb. 18.28. which declares the Dignity of the Prieſts above the Levites; as the Clergy receive Tithes of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and then pay the Tithes of their Tithes to the King: which ſhews the Dignity of the King above the Clergy.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Abraham</hi> took not Tithes, but <hi>Levi</hi> did, and yet <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> took Tithes of him.</p>

                              <p>This is the Gate of the Temple, into which none but Chriſt did ever enter, nor ever ſhall; but all the Righteous ſhall enter in at the laſt day, both Souls and Bodies.<note place="margin">Pſal. 114.20.</note>

                              <p>Therefore the Veil of the Temple was rent in twain, at the Death of Chriſt, to ſhew the opening of the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers.

                           <p>Pain is worſe than death, for death is ſenſeleſs, and hath no feeling. Death is the wiſh of Anger, and the worſt anger doth but wiſh a man dead; but pain is the deſire of Malice. <hi>Feri ut ſentiat mori,</hi> Strike him not to death at once by a dead blow, but ſtrike him ſo that he may die lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, and feel himſelf die.

                           <p>Such was the Croſs of Chriſt, full of Shame to him that ſuffered it; ſo that the Spectators pitied him not at all, but ſcorned a Curſed Wretch upon the Croſs.</p>
                           <p>Stoning and the Sword are Deaths ordained by God; but the Croſs ordained by Men for Rogues and Dogs.

                           <p>And this made his Father forſake him, and this made him cry out with ſuch a bitter Cry, <hi>O God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>

                           <p>And is it come to this? our Saviour dead? Call me to Mourning now, at the Remembrance of this Black deed.</p>
                           <p>When Beaſts are ſlain 'tis ſad, when Men are ſlain, much more; but when ſuch a Man as Chriſt, who was alſo God, moſt of all.</p>

                           <p>A ſad Tragedy: A Man of Sorrows, naked, pierced with Nails, Thorns and Spears, ſore with Laſhes, Bones disjoynted, unpitied by <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſtood ſtaring and looking upon him, and jeering and wagging their heads, ſaying, <hi>Come down from the Croſs, if thou be the Son of God: He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Lord, what a ſight is here? and it grows dark too!</p>
                           <p>That he hung thus dead and mangled, this may be repreſented by Pictures and Pageants, as well as Words, to move compaſſion and tears; and, I will behold the Croſs, the Grave, &amp;c. in my Imagination, and with mine Eyes, and weep over them.</p>
                           <p>Call me therefore again and again to the houſe of Mourning upon this occaſion for I will go. But I look to be called off ſhortly to Joy and Rejoycing, for it is not good to dwell altogether upon Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                           <p>Call me not <hi>Naomi,</hi> but call me <hi>Marah</hi> for a while, becauſe the Lord hath afflicted me; but rejoyce not over me O mine Enemy, for though I be caſt down, yet I ſhall riſe again: And then call me not <hi>Marah</hi> any longer, but call me <hi>Naomi,</hi> by mine own name again.</p>
                           <p>I muſt mourn with thoſe that mourn; but I muſt rejoyce too with them that rejoyce.</p>
                           <p>It will be Eaſter very ſhortly: When the Lord is Riſen, I muſt put off my Mourning-weeds, and deck my ſelf with the garments of Joy and Gladneſs.</p>
                           <p>I muſt not lye any longer in Sackcloth and Aſhes, in this dirty pickle, for I am a Chriſtian, and the Spouſe of Chriſt, and I muſt trim my ſelf, and put on the Wedding-garment and follow the Bridegroom into his Chamber, and feaſt with him.</p>
                           <p>But I cannot forget his Sufferings, therefore call me back again once more, for I muſt not only ſorrow but ſuffer with him. If I muſt ſuffer with and for others, much more with and for Chriſt. If I muſt be like unto

                           <p>Call me to die with Chriſt. I'le go and die with him and for him: Come along with me you that are Chriſt's, and let us die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                           <p>What means this Blood, ſo Innocent? Why ſhould it be ſo baſely ſpilt?</p>
                           <p>For great Reaſons of great ſtate, beſt known to God: Some revealed to us; As,</p>

                           <p>But it muſt be offered firſt; I, and ſo it will very ſhortly, it muſt not lie long here you may be ſure. This Blood muſt quickly be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Heaven, never to be ſpilt more, but offered up for an Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Mercy-Seat of God for ever. 'Twill be but three daies, and this Fleſh and Blood ſhall live again, and after fourty daies it will aſcend into the Temple of God.</p>
                           <p>This Blood will conſecrate and dedicate that place, for our fleſh and blood to enter into.</p>
                           <p>This Blood will be a new and living way to the Mercy-Seat of God, for us to have free recourſe unto at all times in this life for Grace ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to help us in the time of all our need.</p>
                           <p>This Blood will cry aloud for Mercy, and ſpeak better things than the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> which was for Revenge: But it muſt be offered firſt, and it will be accepted.</p>
                           <p>No Sacrifice can be complete, till it be offered. Firſt ſlain, then laid on the Altar, then offered up in part or in whole: ſo was Chriſt firſt ſlain, then offered up to God.</p>
                           <p>Well then, I will be as good as my word, I will mourn, and faſt, and pray a while; but I muſt not think that this will do my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>Sackcloth, Aſhes, Hard lodging and fare, Whippings, Pilgrimages, Reliques, Watching, Faſting, Alms and Oblations, &amp;c. make a great
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49664:127"/> ſhew and pomp of Devotion, and ſome of them are good, as they may be uſed.</p>
                           <p>But I muſt have a ſettled eye upon the Power of Godlineſs, and not upon the Form only. I muſt take heed what I do in the Service of my God, leſt I offer the Sacrifice of Fools. In a word, I muſt look to my heart, in all my outward actions.</p>
                           <p>It will not ſerve my turn to read, hear, or ſee the hiſtory of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Paſſion or Reſurrection written, preached, and acted or repreſented in Books, Sermons and Scenes, and for me thereupon to hang down my head like a Bull-ruſh, and grow ſad upon it for a day or two.</p>
                           <p>I muſt think of an every daies duty, of dying daily, and of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and crucifying my ſelf all my life long, not by Whipping, &amp;c. but by Self-denial, and cutting off my Right hand, or my Right eye, or whatſoever is near or dear unto me. Self-examination, Reformation, Zeal, Faith, Love, Hope, and ſuch Spiritual duties muſt be my work all the daies of my life: For Bodily exerciſe profiteth little or nothing, but Godlineſs and a New Creature.</p>
                           <p>What a fool was <hi>Simon Stylites,</hi> that lived ſo long ſtanding between two Walls; and <hi>Dominius Loricatus,</hi> that gave himſelf 540000 ſtripes in one Lent?</p>
                           <p>I look upon my Saviour's Crucifixion, as do the Literaliſts and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Devotioniſts; but <hi>Surſum corda</hi> is a good hint to me, I muſt look higher.</p>
                           <p>The Hiſtory I believe, but the Myſtery and Power of his Death I look after.</p>
                           <p>It ſatisfies not me at all, if I had been born, and laid in a Manger, and crucified and ſlain with Chriſt; if I had been his Brother, and ſuckt the breaſts of his Mother, it would not have profited me at all, except I did believe the Word of God and keep it, for then I ſhould be his Brother, Siſter, and Mother indeed.</p>
                           <p>If I had been ſo happy as to have known him in and after the fleſh, ſo as to eat and drink with him, and ſee his Miracles, and hear his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and caſt out Devils, and heal Diſeaſes, as he did, in his Name; yet from henceforth I will know him no more after that, but after a better faſhion. His Sufferings and Death are paſt and gone, from hence now I know him as he liveth in the power of an endleſs life.</p>
                           <p>All the ſcandal of the Croſs is taken away; though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God. Break my heart no more with grief and hardſhips of the outward Croſs; but let me love and love again, and delight my ſelf in the inward Croſs, whereby the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World. Then ſtay me with Flagons, comfort me with Apples, when I am ſick of Love.</p>
                           <p>I look upon the Love of God in making and confirming his Promiſes to me in Chriſt. I make my Covenant with my God to forſake the World, the Fleſh and the Devil: This is the ſtate of Grace; this is to be in Chriſt, and a New Creature.</p>
                           <p>I have looked down to Chriſt's Sufferings on Earth, but now I will look up more to his glorious Actings in Heaven; <hi>viz.</hi> His Sacerdotal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; his ſolemn oblation of Himſelf; his Seſſion at the Right hand of God; his Interceſſion; his Kingdom over all in protecting his Church, and bringing all his Enemies under his feet; his ſpiritual Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49664:128"/> and Kingdom in our Hearts, beating down all the ſtrong holds of Sin and Satan.</p>
                           <p>No need therefore of Croſſes, Pictures, Whips, Thorns, Nails, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Theſe may work for a while (being in ſight) upon the outward Man, to move admiration and ſorrow; but no conſtant Faith, and fixed Hope and Love, as do the virtue of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, which is the true Power of Godlineſs, that brings comfort to the end, and in the end, and to all Eternity.</p>
                           <p>The Fleſh (I bear it record) takes a kind of pleaſure in grieving, pitying, and beholding the ſhadows of theſe things; but the Spirit of Faith goes higher, and rejoyceth in the evidence and demonſtrations of the Subſtances themſelves.</p>
                           <p>The Letter and Form alone profiteth little, it is the Spirit and Faith that muſt give the true Life.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except we eat the Fleſh, and drink the Blood of the Son of God, we have no Life abiding in us, becauſe his Fleſh is meat indeed, and his Blood is drink indeed;</hi> but withal he tells us, <hi>That theſe words which he ſpeaketh are Spirit and Life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Call we therefore in the laſt place, and hold there, to the True work of a Chriſtian: To crucifie a Luſt, to kill a Sin, to die to ſin, to riſe from Sin, and live to Righteouſneſs. I whine not at the Paſſion, I weep not for him; but I weep for my ſelf, and mortifie my Members which are upon the Earth.</p>
                           <p>I remember Chriſt's death, and take the Sacrament upon it, as the only Memorial that Chriſt hath ordained.</p>
                           <p>I believe, and bear in mind the hiſtory of the Paſſion; but my main care is to conform thereunto. The Myſtery is more to me than the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; the Spirit than the Letter: The Letter is low, the Spirit is high. Carnal Devotion is in Images and Reliques; but Spiritual Devotion is in Mortification and Self-denial: The one is the form, the other is the power of Godlineſs.</p>
                           <p>We preach and live too low, in the bare Hiſtory, in verbal Maſſes, in ſuperſtitious Rites. Theſe are ſome of them very good when contained within their own ſpheres; but alwaies very low and mean, and never come up to the height and purity of an Evangelical ſpirit.</p>
                           <p>We dwell too much upon outward and carnal things, which are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; as of Water in Baptiſm, Bread and Wine in the Communion, Faſts and Feaſts, Rites and Ceremonies, Penances, Judgments, Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſtretch them too far, or lay too hard a ſtreſs upon them.</p>
                           <p>The two Sacraments ordained by Chriſt, and the other decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church for edification, and the Diſpenſations of outward Puniſhments and Bleſſings are reverently to be obſerved and practiſed; but not in the outſide and Gaiety only, to move humiliation and fear; but in the intrinſecal and eſſential virtue, to create ſpiritual Communion, Love, Joy, and hope of Glory.</p>
                           <p>To uſe Rites is comely, and for Edification; but to multiply them to diſtraction is Jewiſh and Paganiſh, and of it ſelf a dead way, without any ſpirit or life at all.</p>
                           <p>Covet therefore after the beſt of Gifts, and behold, I ſhew unto you a more excellent way! to make it our meat and drink to do the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49664:128"/> will of God, to fulfil all Righteouſneſs outward; but not to reſt there, but to taſte the good Word of God, and the Powers of the VVorld to come, and to have our Spirits throughly exerciſed to diſcern the Truth in all Shadows.</p>
                           <p>I will not ſlight, but reverence every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake, and for Conſcience ſake.</p>
                           <p>I will read, and hear, and ſee the deſcription of Chriſt in a Book, or Sermon, or Picture; but I will come nearer to Chriſt, and cloſe in my Soul with his Spirit.</p>
                           <p>I will be raviſhed with his Love, that died for me and roſe again, and admire, and draw a Curtain, and be ſilent, when I cannot deſcribe nor imagine the infiniteneſs of his Shames and Glories.</p>
                           <p>Call me to Joy and Gladneſs after I have tried all other waies, and to a conſtant walking with God, and full Aſſurance of Heaven.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt hath entred into his Temple, and opened the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to all Believers.</p>

                           <hi>TITLE VIII.</hi> Of Chriſt's Exaltation.</head>
                        <p>CHRIST's Reſurrection manifeſted his Death to be effectual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.57.</note> Law and Death, elſe <hi>our Faith had been in vain, and we yet in our ſins: For he was delivered to death for our ſins, and roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 4.</note> If Death had held him, then neither Sin, nor Law, nor Death, nor Satan that hath the power of Death, had been conquered; and then Sin, and Law, and Death, and Hell muſt have held us for ever.</p>
                        <p>This therefore is the greateſt of all Chriſt's Miracles for the World to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49664:129"/> believe him to be a perfect Saviour, which without it could never have been believed.</p>
                        <p>This takes away all ſcandal of the Croſs, for we worſhip not one was, as the <hi>Jews</hi> call him, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; or as <hi>Lucian,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, a Crucified or Staked-God.</p>
                        <p>But when the Lord was Riſen, then Faith revived: The Diſciples thought this had been he which ſhould have reſtored the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but he was dead and buried, and therefore all their hopes of that ever coming to paſs were dead and buried with him. But now he is Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the Dead, both theirs and ours is riſen up again with him; who though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt's Reſurrection aſſures us of Life after death, of which the World was never aſſured before. 'Tis he that hath <hi>aboliſhed Death, and brought Life and Immortality to light through the Goſpel:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> Who after he had overcome the ſharpneſs of Death, did open the Kingdom of heaven to all Believers.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſons of Philoſophy, to prove the Soul's Immortality, and the Bodie's Reſurrection, though demonſtrative enough, yet are ſo thin and ſubtil, that they glide and ſlip away quickly from Vulgar Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But Chriſt his Soul being in Paradiſe during the Body's abode in the Grave, and his Reſurrection, Appearances, and Converſations, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Aſcenſion into heaven, do put the matter out of queſtion, and more ſtrongly affect Vulgar minds.</p>
                        <p>By and after Chriſt's Reſurrection, he was made Lord and Chriſt, King and Saviour.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt's Oeconomical Kingdom is calculated from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and ſitting at the Right hand of his Father in heaven. <hi>Let all the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>know aſſuredly,</hi>

                        <p>Chriſt, after his Reſurrection receiving this Power, ſits not on his Royal Pavilion, as an idle Spectator of his Subjects from heaven, but gave at firſt a ſenſible demonſtration of his inviſible Power, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Holy Ghoſt in the likeneſs of Fiery tongues upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, inſpiring them with Tongues, and revealing to them the Myſteries of God's Kingdom. —<hi>This JESUS hath God raiſed up,</hi>

                        <p>Elſe at firſt, if it had only been an inviſible Kingdom above, it might have ſeemed a dream to them, which were yet but Novices.</p>
                        <p>But ſince he hath continued, and will continue to ſend down his Holy Spirit into the hearts of all his Servants, not miraculouſly with Signs and Wonders as before; but ordinarily, and yet ſufficiently for the good of their Souls, and the edification of his Church, <hi>till we all come in the Unity of the ſame Spirit, to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And this he will do according to his Promiſe, <hi>Lo, I am with you alwaies, even unto the end of the World.</hi>

                           <p>And this is the wiſh of every true Chriſtian, to have an inward heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not an outward hiding of his inbred Corruptions: The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of a new Life, the Seed of God, the Spirit of Chriſt, inclining our Spirits to the love of God, and of all Righteouſneſs.</p>
                           <p>And this is a thing correſpondent to our true Nature, which is deſirous to act freely and ingenuouſly in the waies of God, out of the Principle of a Living Law written in the heart, and to eſchew Sin, as contrary to a Vital Principle.</p>
                           <p>This was ſomewhat hinted at by the Philoſophers of Old, who judged Vertue not to be merely <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Whether or no this be not that Evangelical Perfection, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> called the <hi>Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi>

                           <p>But this is not the Moral or Legal Righteouſneſs of another made ours, but our Faith gives us a Right and Title to be the Righteous Sons and Heirs of God, and Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt; who maketh us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Rights (not individual, his Perſonal Rights, but) ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, procuring for us the Right of Adoption and Sonſhip after his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Grace, who is the Son of God by Nature, and by the Means and application of Faith made unto us <hi>Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and Redemption.</hi>

                           <p>We have a real Victory over Sin, and a real Righteouſneſs of heart, by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is the property of Light to conquer Darkneſs.<note place="margin">Light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                              <hi>Truth</hi> is the Light in us. This Truth is of God, who hath made it innate and cognate with the Soul.</p>
                           <p>Falſhood and Lies are Darkneſs. This Falſhood is of the Devil, who hath made it adnate and allied accidentally to the Soul.</p>
                           <p>When the Natural Light which was created in the Soul is uſed, by Faith in the Promiſes it is enlightned farther with the ſupernatural light of Grace; and ſo the unnatural Darkneſs of Sin is diſpelled by the Beams of a Heavenly Illumination.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe Sin is no Native,<note place="margin">Sin no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> but a Stranger and Intruder into the Mind, which is the Lord's inheritance; therefore Sin may be conquered and beaten out, and ſhall be beaten out, when a ſtronger than ſhe is come upon her.</p>
                           <p>An adventitious and extraneous thing is expellible by the Original.</p>
                           <p>The true and ancient Nature of the Soul ſuffers violence by theſe Strangers.</p>
                           <p>Sin is the Praeternatural ſtate of Rational Beings.</p>
                           <p>Men are born free and ingenuous: Servitude is unnatural.</p>
                           <p>Therefore as Sin was not Primary, or Connatural with the Soul: ſo we have no reaſon to think, that it ſhould be perpetually adherent, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable there-from.</p>
                           <p>A jarring Inſtrument may be ſet in tune.</p>

                           <p>The Soul was harmonious, as God firſt made it, till Luſt diſordered the ſtrings and faculties thereof: And God, the great <hi>Harmoſtes,</hi> is able eaſily to put it in perfect Concord again.</p>
                           <p>The Soul was perfectly ſound, and Righteouſneſs was the health there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, till Sin made the dyſcraſy: And God, the great Phyſitian of Souls, is able to bring it to the right and perfect temper again.</p>

                           <p>So there are two ways to be free from the Law.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. By illegal breaking looſe from it, and marrying to carnal Liberty, miſcalled Chriſtian Liberty.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Legal marrying to Chriſt, when the Law is dead by crucifying and mortifying of Luſts.</p>

                              <hi>I was alive without the Law once,</hi> that is, the Conſcience was aſleep,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> and I ſinned freely without check of Law or Conſcience thereby, as if I had no Law nor Conſcience at all.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Such as are alive to Law, and to Sin both, that is,<note place="margin">Alive to Law.</note> the Conſcience was convicted of ſin by the Law, and yet hath ſtill a power and love to ſin, both ſtruggling in the bowels of the Soul, which is a ſhattered and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Eſtate, when the Soul hath a Love to ſin, which ſhe knows to be a ſin, and condemned by the Law and her own Conſcience. This is to be ſlain by the Law. — <hi>For I was alive without the Law once;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ro. 7.9, 10, 11.</note> 
                              <hi>but when the Commandement came, ſin revived, and I dyed, and the Commandement, which was ordained to Life, I found to be unto Death. For Sin taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the Commandement deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</hi> In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, there is no peace: All Diſtraction and VVar betwixt the Law of God, the Law of the Mind, the Law of ſin, and the Law of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Such as are dead to the Law and ſin,<note place="margin">Dead to Law.</note> and alive unto God and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. — <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death:</hi> That is, the Law is ſubdued,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> and Sin is conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and the Soul free from the Curſe of the one, and the Dominion of the other, and at liberty to be the ſervant of God and of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>They that are in the firſt eſtate are Sin's Free-men.</p>
                           <p>They that are in the ſecond eſtate are Bond-men to God and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and Slaves, ſerving for fear of Death, and ſo abſtaining from outward Acts, not inward Luſts; Children of <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bond-woman.</p>
                           <pb n="220" facs="tcp:49664:134"/>
                           <p>They that are in the third ſtate are Free-men of God and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as Sons, ſerving God for Love, Children of <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-woman.</p>
                           <p>So it appears that there are great Miſtakes concerning freedom from the Law.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <note place="margin">Carnal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſin.</note>1. By fancying a Carnal liberty to ſin; ſuch are free-men to ſin and wickedneſs, which is a moſt deplorable Thraldom.</p>
                           <p>Theſe men call themſelves Saints, holy in all profaneneſs, and for God too, by opinionative zeal of Enthuſiaſm, and Seraphiciſm, Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally abſtracted from all mixtures below, and highly united and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with God in the Spirit. Epicurizing in the mean while, and making a God of the Fleſh, God ſeeing no ſin in them his Children; needing no Preachings, Prayer nor Good-works, but rapt up in the extaſie of Faith and Love, and abſolute Aſſurance; leaving poor Reprobates in the fetters of Law, and torments of Sin and Damnation, while they enjoy all Liberty and Pleaſures in familiarity with God, who affords them the Liberty of the Creature, which they enjoy to the full, as having the only true Right unto them, and Sin not in all they do.</p>
                           <p>This may be called <hi>Antinomian Liberty,</hi> under the pretence of Free-Grace and a Goſpel-Spirit, becauſe Chriſt hath done all to their hands, and therefore nor Sin, nor Law, nor Death can reach them; ſinning out their ſin, and ſo much the rather, becauſe where Sin aboundeth, Grace doth much more abound!</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <note place="margin">Legal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Ro. 7.5, 19, 20.</note>2.

                           <p>And in this opinion they continue a ſinful and miſerable life, betwixt Hope and Fear, Hearing, and Praying, and Communicating all the while, and truſting to the Work done, and in the End hope all is well, and will be well.</p>
                           <p>And thus they look no farther, ſtill feeding themſelves, eſpecially the Papiſts, with Penances, and Reliques, and Indulgences, and Outward performances; never regarding the Inward killing of Luſts, nor expecting a Living Law written in the heart.</p>
                           <p>This is to forſake our Husband Chriſt, and cleave to the bondage of the Law, which is dead to us by Chriſt's Croſs, and might be dead in us by his Spirit, if we would believe.</p>
                           <p>And the ground of all this Error is from a Novel Interpretation of that Paragraph of the latter part of the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> contrary to all Antiquity, Senſe, or Reaſon.</p>

                           <p>The Reaſons for this Victory over the Law are theſe.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe Grace is ſtronger than the Law.<note place="margin">Grace ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Law.</note> Mercy rejoyces and prevails over Juſtice. The abſolving power of the Goſpel is ſtronger than the condemning power of the Law. The Mercies of God are above all his Works. Prerogative is above Law. Cuſtome overcomes Law, Mercy much more.</p>
                           <p>The Sword of Juſtice is ſtrong and ſharp; but Mercy keeps off the blow, and holds the hand of Juſtice from ſtriking. If the Law calls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud for Juſtice, Chriſt's blood calls louder and pleads for pardon. If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, and the blood of Chriſt is the Propitiation for all ſins. God will have mercy, becauſe he will have mercy, and what is that to the Law? It is the will of God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and paſs by Iniquities, Tranſgreſſions, and Sins, and to remember them no more.</p>
                           <p>When the ſtrong man enters into the houſe, he keeps it and all that is therein, but when a ſtronger than he comes upon him, he binds him hand and foot, and caſts him out. So is the Goſpel to the Law.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Spirit of Grace is ſtronger than the Spirit of the Law.<note place="margin">Spirit of Grace ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Law.</note> The Spirit of Sin is ſtrong in it ſelf, Luſt hath a violent impulſe and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement motion. The Spirit of Sin is ſtronger by the Law, and rages and takes on much more for being oppoſed, Like a Lion ſcorns to be kept in, but breaks down all barrs and bounds to run abroad at randome. But the Spirit of the Law is ſtronger, for though it cannot curb ſin from ſinning, yet it keeps it under the Curſe, that it cannot eſcape it. But when the Spirit of Grace in Chriſt comes, it preacheth deliverance to the Captives, and recovery of ſight to the blind, and opens the priſon doors to them that were faſt bound in miſery and iron, and publiſhes the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Year of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>The Word of God is mighty in operation throegh the Spirit for the beating down of the ſtrong holds of Sin and Satan. As Light is ſtronger than Darkneſs to deſtroy ſin: ſo the Bleſſing of Grace is ſtronger than the Curſe of the Law to take it quite away. Though the Spirit of the Law be the Spirit of God's Juſtice; yet the Spirit of the Goſpel is the Spirit of God's Mercy, which God will have to be more effectual than the other, and Bleſſes whom the Law curſes, yea and they ſhall be Bleſſed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">God delights more in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</note> Becauſe God delights more in ſhewing Mercy than in executing Vengeance, in ſparing than in puniſhing; <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn and live.</hi> Judgment is his ſtrange work. Bowels of mercy, tender pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion are his delightful properties.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Becauſe Man is made to be the object of God's Love, not Wrath;<note place="margin">Man Object of God's Love.</note> his Bleſſing, not a Curſe; Life, not Death. Heaven was prepared for Men and Angels till they ſinned, and then Hell was prepared for them, and ſince that for all Hypocrites like unto them. We cannot imagine in any reaſon, that God made his poor Creatures for everlaſting Deſtruction.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49664:135"/> We may obſerve it in our ſelves, though we be evil, yet we are not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural as to beget children to ſtarve them, or beat out their brains, or leave them to the wide World, or ſend them to the Hangman to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to death. And if we that are evil know well enough notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to give good things to our children, not a Scorpion for a Fiſh, nor a Stone for an Egg, how much more then ſhall our Heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him? and how infinitely more piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and compaſſionate is he, than we can imagine or expreſs?</p>
                           <p n="5">

Becauſe the Pleading of Chriſt for Mercy purchaſed by his own Blood is undeniable to God above all the Pleading of the Law, or the Devil, that lays the Law againſt the Brethren, whoſe malicious accuſer he is. God will not, cannot deny his own Son, and whatſoever we ſhall ask the Father in his Name, he will deny us nothing.</p>

                           <p n="2">2.

                           <p>Thus abundantly hath God provided for us by Jeſus Chriſt, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Souls, and of our Bodies. Our Souls raiſed from the death of ſin, and the curſe of the Law: Our Bodies raiſed from the Grave.

For as long as ſin is in death, unpardoned by dying in ſin, there can be no recovery from Eternal death for ſin. As long as the Debt is not paid, there can be no recovery out of Priſon.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Law is conquered which ſtirred up ſin,<note place="margin">Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</note> and accuſed ſin unto death. Chriſt hath fulfilled the Law, and aboliſhed the Types and Curſes thereof.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Devil is conquered that lays the Law againſt us,<note place="margin">Devil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</note> he came upon us as a ſtrong man to bind us in death, but Chriſt came upon him, and bound him that had the Power of Death, and caſt him and Death both out of doors, and brought life and immortality to light.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49664:136"/> Reſurrection, nor Fellowſhip in his Sufferings, nor any conformity with Chriſt wrought inwardly in our Souls by his holy Spirit: turning all Righteouſneſs into a bare accounting and being imputed Righteous by the Righteouſneſs which is another's, and no inherent Holineſs or Sanctification of the Spirit which is our own, without which no man ſhall ſee the Face of God. This is an Idaea of Holineſs, and the Happineſs will be accordingly. . A Shadow and no Subſtance. This is to deny the Real Evil of Sin, and the Real Holineſs of the Spirit, turning really from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Or elſe this is to make God to be bribed and corrupted by the Sacrifice and Oblation of Chriſt; to indulge men in their own Sins, by clothing them, and hiding them with his Son's Righteouſneſs, though he knows well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough they are inwardly unrighteous: and yet, by vertue of that Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs they ſhall be excuſed from all Sin, and the real Puniſhment of Eternal Death.</p>
                        <p>So there ſhall be an Impunity from God for Sin, than which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater Evil, nor more againſt the Mind of God, who natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hates Sin; nor more againſt the mind of the Godly, who more abhor the ſin, than they dread the vengeance.</p>

                        <p>All the ground theſe men have for what they affirm is their ſtrong belief that it is ſo, without any Senſe or Reaſon, that it ſhould be ſo, or how it can be ſo, that the undefiled Rewards of God ſhould be enjoyed by impure and unregenerate men. But the Pretenſe is, that they ſpeak only of Juſtification, without any Condition of Sanctification, as being no part of God's Covenant, but Faith only. But ſtill, let the ſhew of Humility and Modeſty be what it will in them, and the advancement of the free Grace of God by them, it muſt needs exceedingly deceive men into hypocriſie and carnality, which is very pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                        <p>For he that believes himſelf to be thus abſolutely and compleatly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Imputation of a mere External Righteouſneſs through his Faith, muſt needs believe that there lacketh no other Righteouſneſs of his own; for all ſuch Holineſs is perfectly ſupplied by the Holineſs of another, who is Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And though it be yet pretended, that Sanctification will naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low imputed Juſtification by way of Thankfulneſs, yet this very Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will eaſily be believed, as all other Graces are by them ſuppoſed, to be by the ſame Imputation, reckoned and accounted ſo to be, but not ſo indeed, leſt Grace ſhould not be free, and Works ſhould prove Meritorious; imagining that God makes a Covenant without any Condition, or any other party to Covenant with him, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>

                           <p>But if to live Spiritually be poſſible, Why then do we not live ſo? and how ſhall we anſwer it to God and Men, and to our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? our conſciences will condemn us, and good men will condemn us, and God who is greater than our conſciences, and all the World, will condemn us much more.</p>

If there were faith and hope of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to Glory, it would work a victory over Sin, World, and Devil, and with God's help nothing ſhould be impoſſible unto us.</p>
                           <p>This was typified by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Red Sea, the Wilderneſs, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims Giants, the Towns walled up to Heaven; yet all theſe were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Theſe things are written for our inſtruction, that we through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope: We can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth us: We ſhall be more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors and bruiſe Satan under our feet. If God be with us, who ſhall be againſt us? Only be valiant and of a good courage, and ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>But once more, before I take off my Pen, let me contemplate Chriſt our Mediator in all his Offices</p>
                           <p n="1">1. A Prieſt ſacrificing himſelf on the Altar of his Croſs.<note place="margin">Chriſt a Prieſt.</note> So is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian crucified with Chriſt, dying daily, filling up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt. We bear in our bodies the dying of the Lord Jeſus, becauſe we are his Members, of his Fleſh and of his Bones: We have put on Chriſt, and Chriſt is in us, and we in him.</p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is not aſhamed to call Chriſt's ſufferings his ſufferings. Chriſt himſelf ſaith, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? In as much as ye do it to any of theſe Little ones, ye do it unto me. We are baptized with the baptiſm of Chriſt, and drink of his Cup. His Croſs is ours,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49664:145"/> and ours is Chriſt's; we are to look upon all the ſufferings of Chriſt's members as the ſufferings of the head, for the body is one, and all parts ſuffer together; our members are the members of Chriſt, our bodies the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: we are in Chriſt and Chriſt in us; he ſuffered in his Perſon, we ſuffer in our perſons, we take up his Croſs. We men as Prieſts with him, ſacrifice our ſelves with him, in him, and by him who ſacrificed himſelf for us as God and Man.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <note place="margin">Chriſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit.</note>2. Chriſt quickened his Body by his Eternal Spirit, and ſo entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place to offer up himſelf by the ſame Spirit unto God once for all men; ſo Chriſtians have their Bodies quickned by the Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo enter with him and by him into the holy place, to offer up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God, and are accepted by him for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
                           <p>So we are in Chriſt crucifying and killing our ſelves, that is, our ſins in the bodies of our ſinful fleſh: ſo we are in Chriſt offering up our quickned bodies without ſin, in the Holy place where no unclean thing can ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, following him who hath made way for us, that where he is there we might alſo be; for he being lifted up draws all men after him, and where the carcaſs is, there will the Eagles be gathered together: Thus are we Prieſts to ſacrifice and offer with Chriſt, both in Heaven and Earth.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <note place="margin">Chriſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note>3. Chriſt a Prophet leading us into all truth, and opening unto us the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, that we might be Prophets to teach in his Name, that men and Angels might know the wonderful diſpenſations of the Kingdom of Heaven. This is the light that lighteth every one that cometh into the World: ſo all the Lord's people are Prophets, ſpeaking the wonderful things of God.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <note place="margin">Chriſt a King.</note>4. Chriſt a King, ruling in our hearts, and ſubduing all our enemies, and covering us with everlaſting glory; ſo do we rule by his Spirit over all our luſts which elſe would rule in our mortal bodies, and ſo do we ſubdue our enemies, and bruiſe Satan under every one of our feet, and through him that ſtrengtheneth us, are more than conquerors, triumphing over the World the Fleſh and the Devil, and reigning with Chriſt in his everlaſting Kingdom. All this is by virtue of our union with Chriſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing his ſufferings and glories to us. As Man and Wife are one fleſh: ſo Chriſt and his Church are one Spirit, bone, living, dying, riſing, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſitting together in heavenly places, as Prieſts, Prophets, and Kings, for ever; ſuch honour have all his Saints.</p>
                           <p>Thus hath our Mediator bought us to himſelf, and with himſelf unto God, to be like unto him in his humiliation and exaltation, which is the glorious eſtate of God's Children, ordained to them in his laſt Will and Teſtament, confirmed, executed, and performed by Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be all honour and glory now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>Remember the famous and illuſtrious teſtimony of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cic. lib. de Orat.</note> ſpeaking in the perſon of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> concerning the Laws of the twelve Tables, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant omnes licet, dicam quod ſentio; Bibliothecas meherculè omnium Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophorum unus mihi videtur duodecem Tabularum Libellus, ſi quis Legum fontes &amp; capita viderit, &amp; Authoritatis pondere, &amp; utilitatis ubertate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perare, i. e.</hi> Let all that hear me be never ſo much offended, I will ſpeak boldly what I think, That this one little Book of the laws of the twelve Tables, if it be rightly conſidered as containing the fountains and heads of all Laws, doth excel the Libraries of all the Philoſophers, both for the weight of Authority that it carrieth along with it, and the plentiful profit that is contained therein. The ſame Author alſo affirms,<note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2. de Leg.</note> That Children were wont to learn the Laws of the twelve Tables as their Primar, the better to lay a foundation for knowledg and practice all their life after.</p>
                        <p>The Science of the Civil Lawes that flowed from this fountain of the twelve Tables the moſt and beſt of learned men have ever profeſſed. <hi>Quintus Mutius Servio Sulpitio, cum de jure reſpondentem parum intellex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſet, turpe eſt, inquit, Patritio &amp; Nobili, &amp; cauſas oranti, jus in quo verſatur ignorare, i. e. Quintus Mutius</hi> replyed to <hi>Servius Sulpitius,</hi> when he perceived that he anſwered not as if he underſtood Law, ſaying, It is a ſhame for a Senator, a Noble Man, and an Advocate to be ignorant in the Law which he profeſſeth. I always looked upon true Church men as to be the greateſt Lawyers, and ſuch as therefore, beſide being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the holy Scriptures which are the Laws of God, ought alſo to be skilful in the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Laws of Men, as being the moſt connate and genuine helps for Divinity, creating better Notions by far, as is found by experience, than can be raiſed from inferior Arts, which are all ſubſervient in ſeveral ways, but much leſs, as being more heterogeneal and remote from Divinity, than Laws are.</p>
                        <p>And this you will find to be true to your comfort and ſatisfaction, if you will but give your minds to underſtand the method, rules, caſes, and terms of the Laws, which next to the Scriptures do comprehend in them pureſt Wiſdom, Juſtice and Equity, that is any where elſe to be found.</p>

                        <p>The Devils indeed are in this condition of trembling, becauſe they know they are reſerved in chains of darkneſs unto the judgment of the great day. Therefore when they ſaw Chriſt they were afraid, ſaying, <hi>What have we to do with thee thou, Jeſus the Son of the Moſt High God? art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> And ſurely the Devil would bring men into the ſame condition by frightning them from the ſervice of God to his Altars, as he did the Gentiles. Surely other thoughts of God would better become men than the Devils have, who nevertheleſs in this one thing are far better than ſome men, for they know and confeſs the Juſtice of God upon them for their Apoſtaſie, but theſe blaſpheme God for cruelty and unjuſtice.</p>
                        <p>It being the common principle of Nature in all men, both wiſe and unwiſe (whatſoever other ſentiments and different opinions they had) that God was <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> the moſt bountiful and gracious Being: the greater wonder it is to me, that ſo many Doctrines amongſt the Heathens and Chriſtians too ſhould be received ſo contrary to God's goodneſs and Philanthropy.</p>
                        <p>'Tis very ſtrange that the minds of men ſhould be leavened with this ſowr conceit, and delight to hear of ſuch terrors againſt themſelves, and to have God repreſented to be of that cruel nature to his Creatures which they would be loth to be of to their Children.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Jealouſies of God cannot ſtand with a belief of God's goodneſs: for they imagine him to be good to a few of mankind, of which number they are a part; but for all the reſt, he looks upon them as droſs, and caſt-aways, and therefore he is always contriving new plagues and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for this ſo hated a people, that they ſhall not ſo much as have the leaſt refreſhments of health or peace in this little pitiful ſpan of life, and after this painful and ſhort life ended will hurle them into everlaſting torments.</p>
                        <p>Did ever a more peſtilentious vapour breathe from the bottomleſs Pit, to the ſeizing upon the very vitals of Religion in the Soul's firſt notions and conceptions of a God, to turn off their deſires and loves from him whom they were made to love and ſerve?</p>
                        <p>I have often muſed with my ſelf about the vulgar conceptions of God's Judgments, as if the Divine Goodneſs ſtudied nothing elſe, like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but to throw his Thunderbolts and Plagues upon every ſingle
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49664:152"/> perſon for their particular aberrations, and upon all Nations for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral corruptions, for their converſion, or elſe for their confuſion.</p>
                        <p>That great and fearful calamities have fallen upon the world, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the Flood, and the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the whole Nation of the Jews, &amp;c. mentioned in Divine Writ is moſt evident; Together with the <hi>Aegyptian, Aſſyrian, Perſian, Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires, &amp;c. cannot be denied, together with many particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of wicked men ſignally ſuffering the Divine Vengeance.</p>
                        <p>But that from hence every idle Fancy ſhould dare to ſpecifie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of God's workings upon thoſe nations and perſons, I could never yet underſtand after that faſhion.</p>
                        <p>My thoughts of God have been thoughts of love and kindneſs in him all along from the beginning of the world, but eſpecially in the days of the Goſpel: And that God's love was always to mankind, though not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated, as it is now by Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>How therefore this frowning face of terrors and amazements in his dealings here, giving mortals no reſt for the little ſpace he hath afforded them to ſtay in this world, and plunging them into eternal torments in the world to come, can conſiſt with the gentleneſs and juſtice of his nature, I can in no wiſe be ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>I am not able to conceive of a good Prince, but that he will be always careful to preſerve the lives and fortunes of his good Subjects, and uſe all poſſible means to reduce the rebellions, and ſtill to be ſparing of the blood of his People, even where his Juſtice calls for it.</p>
                        <p>Nay every petty King of a Town or Family will do the ſame within the circuit of his power.</p>
                        <p>How much more then ſhall the Great and Gracious, not only Potentate, but Creator and Redeemer of the World, hover over his poor creatures and ſervants for good, and be infinitely, and therefore inexpreſſibly, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Temporal and Eternal Wellfare?</p>
                        <p>But I am told that God reprobates the far greateſt part of the world to ſhew the Glory of his Juſtice and abſolute Soveraignty over his creatures. And here I muſt cry out <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, O the Depth! and if I be one of theſe Caſt-aways, muſt be as the reſt contented, and for ever ſilent. 'Tis true I muſt, if ſo, and there can be no help for it; nor muſt Mortals complain, for who art thou, O Man, that thou ſhouldeſt diſpute againſt God?</p>
                        <p>But how theſe men, more than others of equal judgments, ſhould come to this pitch of Knowledg to determine this thing thus, I cannot imagine, nor whence they had this revelation.</p>
                        <p>And how this agrees with God's declaration of himſelf to be willing that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the Truth, and not to delight in the death of any Sinner, will put them to a ſtand.</p>
                        <p>Well, however it is, I am ſure that God is good, and if God hath given men reaſon to underſtand what is Juſtice and Mercy, how the wiſdom of God though infinitely above, ſhould be as infinitely contrary to this our humane underſtanding, will be very hard to conceive.</p>
                        <p>Still Juſtice is Juſtice, and Mercy is Mercy in God or Man, though in vaſt differences of degrees.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall never know how, but we may always know that God is Juſt, and can and will do us no wrong.</p>
                        <p>I take the ſafeſt ſide therefore, I hope, if I interpret humbly all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, though ſeemingly never ſo harſh, to be <hi>cum favore;</hi> that if
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49664:152"/> he do, as certainly he does, ſeverely puniſh; yet he will as graciouſly reward thoſe that fear him for all their miſeries in this life.</p>
                        <p>And if God inflicts, as he doth, the ſame Calamnities now under the Goſpel, as he did before under the Law; yet it is in a different manner in the Church's Majority from what it was in her Minority: And that though the former Diſpenſation was in wrath; yet now it is in Grace, and was always juſt.</p>
                        <p>Well, let the Inhabitants of the earth work righteouſneſs as well as they can, and truſt God for his Mercies, and through the tender mercies of God they ſhall be ſure never to miſcarry.</p>
                        <p>I am certain Grace is Grace, and above Wrath, though I ſuffer never ſo much. And that God does not dodgenor lie upon the catch with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to deſtroy them, but rather waits for their converſion to ſave them. I will truſt in God therefore, though I am never able to underſtand the reaſons of his workings.</p>
                        <p>From henceforth I will never go about to meaſure the depths of God's Providences by the ſhallowneſs of my comprehenſions. I will be medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and doing good, and leave all to God.</p>
                        <p>But it is high time to leave this dreadful Subject of miſ-repreſenting God in his Counſels ſo fatal to mankind.<note place="margin">Goſpel-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</note> Let us ſee what other miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings there are of God's Diſpenſations.</p>
                        <p>God was pleaſed ſuitably to the non-age of the Church to addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very much to the lower faculties of the Soul, and the outward ſenſes that were neareſt to them, and did moſt affect them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore he ordained ſplendid Types, ſolemn ſervices, and many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as the pillar of a Cloud and of Fire, the walls of water in the Red Sea, the burning Mount Sinai, the tabernacle and rays of Glory viſible therein, the Temple, &amp;c. But they which look for any ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Expreſſions of Divinity now, miſtake the Genius of a Goſpel-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to a Church Adult, and capable of higher Adminiſtrations.</p>
                        <p>All things ſince Chriſt's coming are managed in a ſedate, ſmooth and ſerene temper. The myſteries of the Goſpel came forth in plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible forms of Speech from Mount Sion without drawing the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Raptures and Extaſies of amazements. God doth not fright men into heaven by viſible Terrours; God expects now a reaſonable Service, a Judicious Religion acted by the Spirit of Love, and of a ſound mind under the Graces, Truths, and Glories of a Goſpel-ſtate for ever to endure.</p>
                        <p>This Spirit of the Goſpel arriving to our Spirits in this aimable and winning manner, creates a generous Spirit above the Evils or Goods in this world, reſolved to go through them and overcome them, and ſettle upon abſolute Eternal Goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>When men's hopes and fortunes are moſt embarqued in the Ship of this World without Faith, They are in continual fears of Shipwrack, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then all is loſt that is before their ſenſe: But when men's hopes and fortunes are all embarqued in one bottom of Divine Faith, they are in continual Hopes and Aſſurances of arrival in the Haven of Glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then all is found that was before their Spirit in the Eye of Faith.</p>
                        <p>This Hope ſo full of glorious and bleſſed Immortality hath ſupported the ſpirits of ſuch as live by their Faith, better than all the Fatality of the Stoicks, or the Jollity of the Epicureans. Theſe can look Sin

                        <p>O how decent a thing it is for Brethren to meet together in Unity! And how prudent is that Devotion, that places all the ſubſtance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the heart, and yet uſes the circumſtances of order to avoid the confuſion of wild Extravagancies?</p>
                        <p>Certain it is, that if every one were left to ſerve God in his own way, there would be no Face of a Church.

                        <p>God and Man have given us our Liberty in Private, only for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick we are reſtrained. This is enough to give content to all Parties, if Reaſon would do it; for this is decent and comely in the ſight of God and Man.

It may be that ſome New Veins of Golden Oar are found out, which ancient and learned Indagators could not come at; and our new men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too confident that all was done to their hand, and lazy withal, never looked after. And this is the cauſe why ſo many excellent men have raiſed the Line of Evangelical knowledg among us ſo little above what was delivered unto us by our firſt Reformers. Such are become guilty of doing little elſe with that talent of Goſpel-light, which God gave them at firſt as a ſtock to ſet up and trade withal for him; but only to put it in a Napkin, not adding a hair's breadth to their Stature in the knowledg of Chriſt; Hereby falling into that ignoble Principle, <hi>to believe as the Church believes, and take all upon Truſt.</hi>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49664:162"/> Stones: But we may build upon this foundation ſuitable matter which will endure the Fire. Chriſt Jeſus delivered the full perfection of all truth, the moſt pure precepts, and higheſt promiſes in the Goſpel. The Apoſtles (but it was a long time firſt) underſtood it, and preached it to the world. The chiefeſt things which Chriſt did, ſuffered, and ſpake, are written in the Goſpels; as alſo the Sermons, Miracles, and Acts of the Apoſtles; in the Epiſtles alſo, are occaſionally taught the pure Doctrine of Chriſt unmixed with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Vain Philoſophy. The Apoſtles by Inſpiration underſtood the whole Will of God, and preached infallibly; and from their Light we all receive Light.</p>
                  <p>But Inſpiration and Infallibility dying with them; the Diſciples of the Apoſtles, and their Diſciples, were good men, and kept the Faith, which was delivered to them; and ſo it hath been kept, and would have been kept by conſtant tradition of Preaching; if ſo much had not been written, as is written.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the Will of God was plainly revealed,<note place="margin">Corruption.</note> and as plainly underſtood: but ſome after the Apoſtles days, grievous Wolves entred into the Flock of Chriſt, even Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Gentile Chriſtians; who wreſted the Scriptures, both Old and New to their own deſtruction; and too much truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to art and ſubtilty, corrupted the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p>Then as mens Pride with their wealth and worldly polities encreaſed, came in the Doctrines of Infallibility, Supremacy, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Maſſes, worſhipping of Saints and Angels, innumerable Superſtitions of Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and carnal ſervices. And though in all theſe ages good men ſaw the clearneſs of Goſpel truths through theſe miſts of vulgar errors, yet could not ſwim againſt the Stream; and the common ſort relying upon men of mighty names, grew careleſs to ſearch any further, believing all that was told them by their Leaders. The reſt contented themſelves, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49664:163"/> ſate ſtill under thoſe Tyrannies, wiſhing for Reformation: but they were poor and weak, and the violence of the Powers and Multitudes was too ſtrong againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Such was the humour of thoſe dark and ignorant ages, when the modeſt Diſciple would not preſume to know more than his admired Maſter; though he were fit to be a Maſter himſelf to others.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the world lay in a trance for a long time, and fetcht a ſound ſleep, and was almoſt dead; eſpecially in and about the Eleventh Century, that unhappy age overſpread with Ignorance and Barbarity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>Till by degrees ſome more Heroick Spirits appeared, and boldly told the world thoſe glorious truths, which they had diſcovered; as <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Caſſander, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. who weeded out many Tares that the Enemy had ſown, while good men were faſt aſleep.</p>
                  <p>And ſince that greater men than theſe have more and more illuſtrated the Spiritual Diſpenſation of the Goſpel to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, far different from that which was before the Law, and under the Law. And ſtill we go on to perfection, not for a new Faith or Religion; but for the underſtanding of the old way of God more perfectly.</p>
                  <p>The Reformation grows higher and higher every day, and the Faithful grow more and more ſpiritual and fitted for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, walking more ſublimely and freely in the ſpirit above the ſlavery of Carnal Ordinances: a higher Genius hovers over this Age.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reformers did well, and cleared much rubbiſh out of the way; and by their help others have come on to do more good.</p>
                  <p>And now the great points delivered by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other inſpired Writers, concerning Faith, Juſtification, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Grace, Law, Works, Adoption, Prieſthood, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Mediation of Chriſt, &amp;c. are better underſtood and more clearly expreſſed than ever they were before.</p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:49664:163"/>
                  <p>The world hath as good Wits as ever it had, and nothing hinders yet the farther advancement of all knowledg divine and humane, but the ſlaviſh tying our ſelves to the ſole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Antients without examinination of Scriptures and Reaſon, making it religious to go no further than they; for fear of being wiſer than our Fathers; Beſides the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful idleneſs of men of excellent parts, for fear, Forſooth, of dangerous Innovations.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean that we ſhould find out a new Religion, but labour to underſtand the old better: Enquire for the old ways that have been untrodden, and by ways invented not for new Lights, but for old better diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>But what have I done, that talk ſo much of improvement? A little I do God knows! And thanks be to God, if it be a little; I hope others more able will be perſwaded to do more. I have only ſhewn a good heart, and there is no hurt, I hope, to wiſh well to the peace of Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>Well, be it how it may be, 'tis agreeable to a Goſpel-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to pray for and aſpire towards perfection; to ſtrive to be no longer children, but in underſtanding to be men; to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet after the beſt gifts, and to find out the moſt excellent ways; and all this while to keep liberty and peace. And however men fail out of meekneſs and ignorance; yet I condemn none that have honeſt hearts, and ſtrive to know and do better things.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe that ſwell and look big upon all, but their own party, let them alone till their ſtomacks come down; or if they will be wilful, let them be wilful ſtill: only I am ſorry in the mean time, that the blind ſhould lead the blind; but the obſtinate only ſhall fall into the ditch. But they may ſay worſe of me, and therefore I had beſt to hold my peace, for fear of bringing an old houſe over my head; for fear of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwarms of Waſps about my ears.</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It is well known to wiſe men, that the chiefeſt of the firſt Reformers and Compilers of thoſe Articles had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eye to the <hi>Augustan</hi> confeſſion, and yet reſpected the <hi>Geneva</hi> Church too; ſo that both parties have ſubſcribed: ſo could they not do to the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> It was therefore prudently and charitably done of our Church not to fright any from her Communion; but to open her breaſts freely to all that would ſuck in her Doctrine. Nor does our Church forbid her Sons to ſee farther, if they can, into her truths, or to build upon her foundations. This were to ſet bounds to all induſtry and ingenuity, as God hath ſet bounds to the Sea, ſaying, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are everlaſting Mines, new veins diſcovered to men that take pains to dig, or elſe all is loſt; vaſt Treaſures hid in them require ſearching to the world's end. Who can hinder invention and induſtry with moderation? And why may not the old foundation be enlarged and ſtrengthned, and new ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures raiſed thereupon?</p>
                  <p>Is it good to be ſtraitned or confined under penalties to a certain number of Articles in Religion, beſides or beyond the letter of which none ought to ſpeak or write? May not ſucceſſion ſee farther into the ſame truths, and more clearly?</p>
                  <p>The Tabernacle muſt have room to ſpread her curtains, and enlarge her cords, that ſhe may receive the more compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſtand the ſurer.</p>
                  <p>But if any thing be brought in contrary to the ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the faith always received, though it ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by an Angel from heaven, let him be <hi>Anathema Maran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heat of the angry Reformation may be well near out by this time, it is high time it ſhould. Did we not take ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things upon truſt? And did we not flie from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49664:164"/> to another? And may we not in all this time ſee our miſtakes, and honourably reform them?</p>
                  <p>Lay aſide therefore all heats and intereſts, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be far better and ſooner done; and when it is done, we will be glad and rejoyce, and wiſh it had been done ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, is it not good encouragement to ſearching and free ſpirits to look out farther, and find out higher Truths? which, if they be ſtopt by reproach and perſecution, will perhaps lie undiſcovered. Who will take pains, if they be diſgraced and cried out upon for Hereticks and dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators, and kept under the hatches to pleaſe the humours of formal men?</p>
                  <p>What ſenſe or reaſon is there, that the Doctrine or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſtian Religion ſhould not be reformed in every Age from any error or ſuperſtition, which ſhall creep into them by any evil cuſtome, becauſe of antiquity? Or that we ſhould not ſtir a foot from thoſe by-paths becauſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity? (we know they were good men, but they did not ſee all things) as the Latin Service, the half Communion, &amp;c. merely out of a wilful formality and pretence of Conſtancy, though we be convinced of ſuch falſe ways?</p>
                  <p>It is no ſhame for any man, or ſociety of men, to recant a manifeſt miſtake. Do not all wiſe Law-makers the ſame, when manifeſt inconveniences do ariſe, for the peace and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Common-wealth? And why not the ſame for the Church alſo? Is it not the bane of Chriſtianity to be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in maintaining old errors merely out of pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and dangerous change, and queſtioning of old truths alſo? May not a change be ſafely and honourably made from worſe to better in any Church or State? Think again, and is it not piety, wiſdom, and charity ſo to do? I humbly leave it to the wiſe to judg of theſe things.</p>

                        <p>And becauſe the conditions or things diſpoſed to be done are contingent, for daily experience ſhews that many of them are not done; therefore the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or things diſpoſed to be had are contingent; for daily experience ſhews that they are not had.</p>

                        <p>The object of God's Predeſtination or purpoſe to diſpoſe are not Perſons only, but things alſo, with relation to perſons; and it is all one in effect to predeſtinate the perſon to have or do a thing, and to prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate

                           <p>The beſt Diſpoſition that can be made by God or Man, is of an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; becauſe an Inheritance is an univerſal right to the whole Eſtate of the Teſtator. And ſuch is the Inheritance of the Eſtate of God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>For the gift of God is Eternal Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, in whom we are heirs and co-heirs; for all things are ours, and we are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's; and if God hath given us Chriſt, How ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</p>
                           <p>Now becauſe by the works of the Law, which is the firſt Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by way of Teſtament, no fleſh living can be juſtified to the Inheritance of Eternal Life, which was by promiſe; therefore Juſtification is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the works of the Law by faith in the promiſes of the Goſpel, which is the ſecond Diſpoſition by way of Teſtament.</p>
                           <p>So then Legal Righteouſneſs by works is altogether inſufficient as to give us any Right or Titles to the Kingdom of Heaven, and Evangelical Righteouſneſs of Faith is the only means to obtain the Inheritance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> All things are given indeed freely, becauſe Chriſt is given, but not abſolutely without any condition; for ſuch a gift is not in wiſdom and honour, to give all and expect no return, no not ſo much as of Love and Obedience. As for Recompenſe and Requital, there can be none in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49664:169"/> Receiver; nor is expected or needed from the Giver. But every gift ought to be diſpoſed prudently, elſe it is no true bounty, but waſte and prodigality. And all ſuch gifts are thrown away, from which there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no true benefit to the Receiver, nor honour to the Giver. Now God doth all things moſt freely, and with the greateſt love imaginable; and moſt wiſely according to the counſel of his own Will, for the praiſe of the glory of his Grace.</p>

                           <p>No benefit intended by a Benefactor can be conveyed without accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor ought to be, without obligation of improvement and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of duty and gratitude.</p>

Nothing but dead things therefore, or ſuch as are void of ſenſe or reaſon are merely paſſive: but living and reaſonable things are active, becauſe they have Wills; and if they have Wills, they are not in vain, but can act according to ſuch Wills, whether they be of ſenſe only, or ſenſe and reaſon both together, or pure reaſon all alone, as Brutes, Men, and Angels.</p>

                        <p>All kinds of living creatures have their ſeveral individual perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from each other. But moſt commonly we aſcribe perſonality to none but rational creatures, which are partly corporeal, and partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal; partly temporal, and partly eternal; or wholly ſpiritual, and wholly eternal. And theſe are Angels and Men.</p>
                        <p>For theſe ſeveral ſuſtſiſtencies, and for them all in general, the good things of God were created and beſtowed upon them by promiſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as having only among all the reſt underſtandings to know, and wills to chooſe them for their uſe and comfort.</p>
                        <p>For theſe therefore being the beſt of God's creatures he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all things elſe; but more eſpecially for mankind, to whom by Will and Teſtament he hath given the principal inheritance of bleſſedneſs in Chriſt, and by Codicil annexed the acceſſories of the helps and comforts of Angels and all other creatures.</p>
                        <p>And theſe by their knowledg of God's Grace and Bounty have will to embrace and entertain theſe great gifts, and to offer to God themſelves and all that he hath given them for his ſervice and glory, and to do all his farther will and pleaſure, which he ſhall for ever command them.</p>

                           <p>This ſtate and condition theſe humane perſons are put into by God,<note place="margin">Freedom.</note> which muſt needs be a ſtate of Liberty and great Honour. For Slavery is incapable of any Right to any thing. Slaves poſſeſs not, becauſe they are poſſeſſed; they have no Wills, becauſe they are at the Wills of others; nor can they act or ſuffer any thing, do no right, nor ſuffer any wrong, becauſe they are dead in Law, and as dead by them neither Right nor Wrong can be had, done or ſuffered, and to them no Right or Wrong can be inflicted.</p>
                           <p>This Freedom is of Sons in the Family, and Citizens in the Common-wealth of God. This gives them capacity and receptibility of Rights, if they will conſent to receive and enjoy them.</p>
                           <p>Being therefore placed by God in this noble eſtate and way of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they may and ought to look out and ſue for thoſe pretious promiſes that God hath made them: To the atchievement whereof he requireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but their own faith and acceptation, without which it is morally impoſſible that any gift of good-will ſhould take effect.</p>
                           <p>And as men are thus made by God liberal agents, freely to accept, or freely to reject, hold or let go; ſo accordingly they may and do chooſe or refuſe, enjoy or loſe. If they accept, they ſhall have the mercy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when they have it, if they take care, they may hold and keep it, and encreaſe it conſtantly to the end of the full enjoyment, when they are out of all harm's way, above and beyond all frailty or temptation to let go their hold.</p>

                           <p>But while it is time he may recover again:<note place="margin">Recovery.</note> For God does not dodge with him, either to take him at the firſt refuſal of his Grace, and never offer him more; or to take him at the firſt faileur after acceptation, and never ſuffer him to recover himſelf again. God's ways are not like man's ways, neither are his thoughts like man's thoughts; but they are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhion. We are too apt to think of God, as if he were ſuch an one as our ſelves to do as we do, and lie upon the catch according to our evil
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49664:171"/> natures: but there is mercy with God, and therefore he may be feared and hoped and truſted in. Men will lie cloſe and take men at advantage, ſeize upon forfeitures, re-enter, ranſack and play the devil and all in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and fierceneſs: It is not ſo with God; if it were, wo worth to the world, it were better for us that we had never been born, or that we had been like the untimely fruit of a woman, and had never ſeen the Sun. But thanks be to God for his infinite grace, but no thanks to the world at all: If I fall there, I may lie and periſh and none careth for it; but if I fall here, I may repent, and riſe, and recover all, and be in as good and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition than before, and continue to the end. And all this is the Grace of God: and there is no ſuch grace amongſt the Sons of Men, nor nothing like it; For they neither will nor can do after this faſhion, the tender Mercies of the wicked are cruel. God only wounds and heals again, he only kills and makes alive, he brings to the grave and back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and his Compaſſions fail not, and therefore we ſee the Sons of Men are not conſumed.</p>
                           <p>As therefore after Exile all Rights of a free man are loſt; but when a return is made, he is reſtored into his priſtine eſtate <hi>jure Poſtliminii,</hi> with a capacity to acquire and retain all other Rights that he is or ſhall be proper for: So after Spiritual bondage and Captivity all Rights are loſt, becauſe Faith it ſelf the veſſel that held them is ſhipwrackt; but when there is a return (though by the ſingle plank of Repentance, or any other eſcape, which we can make to ſhift for our ſelves to get into our own country again) we are fairly, and fully, and freely received and welcomed into all our former Rights and Priviledges, and met and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by our heavenly Father, and joyfully entertained and engaged by heaped up Favours and Oblivions of all former miſcarriages, never to be ſo negligent, as to ſuffer our ſelves to be ſurprized and taken by the common enemy, and kept from God and our own Country any more.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Collections. Rather hurt ones ſelf than others.</note> is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and wrong; yet rather would I chuſe to hurt my ſelf a little, or my Eſtate, or Good name, than to do hurt or wrong to another in his Perſon, Eſtate, or Good name. And according to the tenderneſs that is in me, I could the better bear my own ſufferings and wrongs done by my ſelf, or others to my ſelf, than the ſufferings and wrongs which I have done by my neglect or malice to other men. I had much rather complain againſt my ſelf, than give juſt occaſion for others to complain againſt me. If this be not ſo much wiſdom, it may be the more mercy, and tender compaſſion.</p>
                           <p>I can make a better ſhift to deal with my ſelf, and ſatisfy my ſelf, than to deal with others, and ſatisfy them that perhaps will never be ſatisfied. I had rather crie out againſt my ſelf and puniſh my ſelf, than that others ſhould juſtly cry out againſt me or perſecute me. And if they clamour or perſecute me unjuſtly, I can the better bear it.</p>
                           <p>If I be the worſe for my ſelf, I hope I ſhall take it patiently; and if I be the worſe for others, I hope I ſhall take it patiently; and if I ſuffer from God, I hope I ſhall take it moſt patiently: for I have moſt reaſon ſo to do, becauſe I am ſure I have deſerved it. God is juſt and merciful, and will lay no more upon me, than what is due, and what he will make me able to bear, and will deliver me in his due time. But as for men, there is no meaſure in their Malice and Cruelty. Let me therefore rather fall into the hands of God, for with him there is mercy; but let me not fall into the hands of men, for their very tender mercies are cruel.</p>
                           <p>But ſtill I ſay (in the mind I am in, and I hope I ſhall ever be of this mind, and I am ſure it is the mind of Chriſt;) whatever becomes of me as to ſuffering of wrongs from my ſelf or others, I will endeavour by the Grace of God, that no body ſhall ſuffer any wrong directly or indirectly from me, that though I be the worſe for my ſelf and others, yet no body ſhall be the worſe for me in his body, ſoul, goods, or good name.</p>
                           <p>I may poſſibly do my ſelf as much right, as I have done my ſelf wrong; but it is for the moſt part impoſſible to do others as much right, as I have done them wrong; to give ſatisfaction to the full is very hard in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Alas! others cry bitterly, but it is better I ſhould cry than they.</p>
                           <p>Of all things I do not deſire to have this to anſwer for, that I have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done, or intended to do any wrong to any man any manner of way. Of all cries, let me not have any cries againſt me from others; for mine own Conſcience will be ſure to cry moſt of all againſt me for ſo doing.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Let me never have any juſt occaſion, O my God, to cry out againſt my ſelf for temporal or ſpiritual injuries done to my ſelf or mine own fleſh, that I and they might have been healthy, and ſound in body or mind, if it had not been for my intemperance, and wicked counſel, infecting my ſelf and them in body and ſoul.</p>
                           <p>That I or they might have been wealthy and rich in Temporal or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eſtate, if it had not been for my Prodigality, or Injuſtice, or Atheiſm, being a canker in my Eſtate and theirs, and a poyſon to me and their Souls; that I have not fed my ſelf or mine at all, or as I ought; or provided for my ſelf or them at all, or as I ought; that I have not taught my ſelf or them at all, or as I ought.</p>
                           <pb n="308" facs="tcp:49664:178"/>
                           <p>But eſpecially let not an army of ſtrangers and of miſerable perſons made ſo by me, come in againſt me to rail and curſe me, or go to God with ſtrong cries and tears to help them from the wrongs that I have done them, or call for vengeance from Heaven upon me for the ſame.</p>
                           <p>O theſe are lowd and bitter cries! O they rent the very heavens! O they come up to the ears of God day and night! O what ſhould I do, or whether ſhould I go, if theſe Fatherleſs, Widows, Strangers ſhould come in againſt me! which God forbid; or if the very brutes and inanimate creatures ſhould find mouths to clamour to men, to God, and to the world againſt me. And all this while, which is worſe, I ſhould cry lowdeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelf in a wounded Conſcience, which who is able to bear?</p>
                           <p>Therefore what ever I do, what ever I ſuffer, let me not eat the bread that ſhould nouriſh others, and for want of which they curſe and ſtarve. Let me not be cloathed with the fleece that ſhould keep others warm, and for want of which their nakedneſs is diſcovered, and they die for cold. Let me not ſhelter my ſelf under the roof of another, which ſhould be his caſtle to ſave himſelf; nor let me poſſeſs the goods or lands of others, which they of right ſhould uſe or enjoy. In a word, Let none be hurt, lamed, killed, deformed, oppreſſed, robbed, ſpoiled, or undone by me; let no ſuch ſtain be upon my honour in this world, nor no ſuch clog upon my ſoul to preſs it down in the world to come. But rather let me truly ſay to my comfort and credit, Whoſe Oxe have I taken, or whoſe Aſs have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? I am innocent from the blood of all men, I have endeavoured to get and keep a good Conſcience in all things void of offence to God or Man, which will bring me peace to my latter end, and to all eternity.</p>
                           <p>O <hi>Adam, Adam,</hi> What inevitable wrongs are done by thee, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and deaths brought upon all thy Race; if not the ſins by thy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at leaſt the imputation for thy ſake?

What waſte and havock and ſpoil have beaſtly, prodigal and barbarous men made upon the good creatures of God, ranſacked, rifled, and preyed upon by your pride and wantonneſs?</p>
                           <p>The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt all right, The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> recovered all right. God created all right and truth, and the Devil created all wrong and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Theſe are the two principles of right and wrong, good and evil.</p>

                        <p>All Perſons for themſelves and in communion with others have Actions or buſineſs about things, in which and to which they have a right: Theſe Actions are Thoughts and Words, the tokens of thoughts or deeds, the effects of words, or ſigns the repreſentation of deeds. By all which Men act either by themſelves, or by their proxies, or for themſelves, or for others.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Intention.</note>1. In Actions there is required the Intention of the Agent, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Uunderſtanding and the will: for he that acts muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he acts, that he may perform and direct them wiſely to the right objects, and be affected with his actions, that he may be zealous in them.</p>
                           <p>The Law requires all thing to be done with full purpoſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and free deſire or will; for elſe nothing can be finiſhed or well done: Elſe if any thing be done ignorantly or raſhly, <hi>pro non facto eſt.</hi> The free will and conſent is neceſſary, for then that is of force which is done. Therefore he is not judg'd to will, who is under the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of another Man, as of his Father or Lord; nor hath a Minor or fool, or Mad-man any will at all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ejus eſt velle qui poteſt nolle:</hi> He is ſaid to will, that can alſo nill. And the Will is expreſſed by ſilence, or ſpeaking, or writing, or ſigns, or a Meſſenger.</p>
                           <p>Actions done in heat or paſſion are no Actions, till they be ratified by perſeverance in them, and thereby they are confirmed to the judgment of the mind indeed.</p>
                           <p>They that err are not properly ſaid to conſent to Action; and in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs if ſuch miſtakes do intervene, that which is ſo done by error is of no force, meaning the error of fact, not of Law.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Nam Juris ignorantia nocet, facti non nocet:</hi> That which comes to paſs by chance, is imputed as a crime to no Man. Fate deſtroyes all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of will or action: Alſo nothing is ſo contrary to conſent, as force or fear; if the force be of greater violence than can be oppoſed, and if the fear be ſuch as may fall upon a Man of valour.</p>

                           <p>In Actions alſo there is required the Execution of them,<note place="margin">Execution.</note> that they may take their full effect; elſe the Actions are imperfect. The Actions muſt appear to be conſummate, or otherwiſe it is as if they were not at all; ſo for words clearly ſpoken and underſtood. The Action ſo done is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, the thing completely finiſhed for the uſe intended; and words effectually ſpoken according to their true meaning.</p>
                           <p>That which is done or ſpoken obſcurely, muſt receive interpretation from the affection of the doer or ſpeaker, or from that which is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or for the moſt part is ſo taken, or that which the thing willing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>That Actions may have their juſt effect, it availeth much whether they be done purely and abſolutely, or are put off till a day be come, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended till a condition be performed.</p>
                           <p>So when any one ſtipulates purely or abſolutely, the thing ſtipulated begins to be due, and is due, and it may be ſued for preſently. When any Man ſtipulates conditionally till a day become; that time is begun, but not come, and the thing ſtipulated cannot be ſued for, till it come. When any Man ſtipulates conditionally till a thing be done, the time is not begun, nor the day come, while this condition of deed is depending.</p>
                           <p>There are ſome Acts which admit of no condition nor time, as Eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation, and Adition upon an inheritance, and ſuch Acts of Law. And where conditions are admitted, they muſt be poſſible and good, and fit for contract, agreeable to Law and good manners, and diſcretion, and without fraud: for <hi>Impoſſibilium nulla eſt obligatio.</hi>

                           <p>So the Will is the ſole miſtreſs of all moral actions;<note place="margin">Free-will.</note> 
                              <hi>Deus poſuit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem in manu conſilii ſui,</hi> God having left Man to his own choice, which to make, even in things concerning this life, cannot be without the Divine Grace, for that liberty of Will is the Gift of God. And in greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters much more doth the ſame Grace aſſiſt and direct our choice: which direction or aſſiſtance we may obſerve and uſe, or we may let it alone. For the ſame Will that is free to uſe, is free to refuſe; God intending that we ſhould glorify him by our free obedience, hath ſet before us good and evill, and we may chooſe which we will, and that ſhall be our portion. For all things of this nature he hath left us to our ſelves, that is to our own choice, not to our natural ſtrength merely; for he hath inſtructed us what to chooſe by giving us wiſdom to underſtand the nature of things, and the event of actions good or bad, and hath invited and excited our Wills by the excellent amabilities of virtue, and the glorious objects of Reward, and by all the aids of the Spirit of Grace hath enabled our Wills to do their own work well, not by new faculties, but by new aids. Juſt as Nature is by <hi>Phyſick</hi> enabled to proceed in her own work, nutriment, and removal of contrary impediments: ſo does the Spirit of God in us, and to us, and for us; and after all this the Will is to chooſe by its own concreated power given of God, and again ſeconded by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural help.</p>
                           <pb n="318" facs="tcp:49664:183"/>
                           <p>And as ſure as God's Grace is neceſſary, ſo ſure it is that we have that grace which is neceſſary; for if we had not, God could not in juſtice or wiſdom commad us to do thoſe works, which are impoſſible to be done.</p>
                           <p>So God calls every Man to chooſe the good and eſchew the evill, and before this choice they muſt deliberate: and God hath revealed this good, which he would have us know and chooſe, that we may deliberate and reſolve for the beſt, which if we do not, it is our fault. God is ſo manifeſted by the Law written in the hearts, and by his benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, that no Man hath juſt cauſe to ſay, he knows not God; and if he would uſe that knowledg well, he might have more; and nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God's part, he may have all things neceſſary if he will, and if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

It may be a good choice, which the will may make; and it may be a bad choice, according as the Spirit or the fleſh may prevail. The Mind aims to direct the Will to good, and may miſs it; for the fleſhly appetite may draw it down from its its intended object. The ſcales hang <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> not knowing which way to tend: The <hi>Magnetick</hi> needle trembles long and waggs this way and that way, before it ſettles upon the Beloved north, much adoe.</p>
                           <p>It is a ſign we do not fully underſtand, and therefore are not fully in love with the Beauties of God as they deſerve: for if we did, we could not poſſibly incline to diſobedience: we ſhould have no ſuch liberty left as to deliberate and diſpute, whether we ſhould do good or no, but ſhould abſolutely run upon it, and do it at the firſt apprehenſion: For there is no deliberation, but when there is ſomething to be refuſed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be preferred; which could not be, but that we underſtand good but little, and love it leſs. For the Saints and Angels in Heaven and God himſelf love good altogether, and cannot chuſe evil at any rate; becauſe to do ſo were imperfection and infelicity, which is no perfect liberty: and the devils and accurſed Souls hate all good, and chooſe all evill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this liberty and indifferency.</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49664:183"/> them what it was impoſſible for them to know, who were <hi>Populus volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi> and would have known more if they could.</p>

                           <p>There are in the Goſpels two proverbial ſayings, <hi>He that is not with us, is againſt us; And he that is not againſt us, is with us.</hi> The firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes an active will, the latter ſeems to approve of an indifferent will, and to allow a Neutrality; both theſe muſt needs be true, but indiſtinct meaſures.</p>
                           <p>The firſt, <hi>He that is not with us, is againſt us,</hi> is meant of thoſe that are in Covenant with God: theſe are paſt the preparation and diſpoſition, and are come to the bearing of fruit; which if they do not, ſeeing they are already in the Tree, ſuch branches muſt be cut off.</p>
                           <p>And ſo he that doth not love God, is his enemy; and not to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is to go backwards. They muſt confeſs with their mouth, and practiſe in their actions what they believe in their hearts, or elſe their Faith is vain: for <hi>obſtat quicquid non adjuvat,</hi> All hinders in this caſe that helpeth not: unleſs we gain that have a talent, we are unprofitable Servants.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond, <hi>He that is not againſt us, is with us,</hi> is meant principally of thoſe that are ſtrangers, but Candidates for being Citizens, and in alliance with God. Theſe will not be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s enemies, but would fain be his friends. <hi>Eſt quiddam prodire tenus,</hi> It is ſome thing to be ready to ſtep forward, to long to be better; this little is ſomething, and that's more than nothing, to wait for the moving of the waters: So <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſide, becauſe he would not be againſt him: So <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> was for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he conſented not to his death; a good Man, and of a friendly mind to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had a good will, though he came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by night, and many others that concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for fear of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Many do as well as they can, and others as well as they may; and all do ſomething, and God is pleaſed with it; and if they hold in this mind, he will help them to do more and pleaſe him better.</p>
                           <p>He that doth not diſ-believe, is in a fair way to believe; he that doth not ſtop his ear, is in a fair way to hear. Such are not far from the Kimdom dom of God, allmoſt and may be altogether <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They know no farther, but believe what they know, and will believe more; when they do know what they ſhould believe. Till when God will not caſt them off, but call them on, ſaying; <hi>Come unto me all you that labour, and are heavy laden with the burden of your ſins, and ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls. Ho every one that thirſteth, let him come and drink the waters of life. Let them come and buy wine and milk, &amp;c. without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price.

                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the next verſe renders the reaſon of this aſſertion, That all Men therefore die, becauſe they are all deſcended from <hi>Adam:</hi> Becauſe they had no Law given them, which for the breach thereof did threaten the puniſhment of death upon the tranſgreſſors. He denyeth not but that ſin was in the world from <hi>Adam,</hi> till the Law was given; as the ſin of <hi>Cain,</hi> and of thoſe before the Flood; of <hi>Cham, Noah, Sodom,</hi> the Brethren of <hi>Joſeph, Pharaoh</hi> and others after the Flood: but never no death me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced, till <hi>Moſes</hi> by his Law did inflict death for the more hainous
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49664:188"/> offences; becauſe ſin is not imputed, and conſequently not puniſhed, where there is no Law; that is, ſin was not therefore imputed to any, that it ſhould be to them the cauſe of death, to wit, to every particular Man. For God then did not puniſh each particular Man with death for their ſin, but he puniſhed all Mankind, and amongſt them Infants and Children, that were never guilty of any ſin: But the Law ſpeaks to every perſon that ſins ſaying, <hi>That Soul ſhall die the death:</hi> that is, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelf would cut him off by death, if either the Judges were ignorant of his crime that had deſerved it, or if they neglected to do their duty.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs death reigned all that while ſtrongly, even from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was a long time, even two thouſand five hundred Years, and ſpared none; no, not thoſe that never ſinned after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, that is, that had committed no ſin like unto that which <hi>Adam</hi> committed, ſuch as <hi>Abel, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Joſeph.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is ambiguous, and in ſome ſenſe may be attributed to all; therefore the Apoſtle diſtinctly explains himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what kind of ſin he ſpeakes, to wit of that ſin which may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equal with that ſin which <hi>Adam</hi> had committed: for great ſins uſe to be compared to the ſin of <hi>Adam, Hoſ.</hi> 6.7.</p>
                        <p>The judgment given upon <hi>Adam</hi> for his offence was Baniſhment from Paradiſe, A curſe upon the ground for his ſake, a miſerable painful life, and at laſt an everlaſting death: and this judgment was not perſonal only to determine with him, but it was reall and hereditary to him and to his heirs for ever. For as by his offence his innocency was corrupted, ſo by his judgment his Poſterity was tainted, and his Blood ſtained: For firſt none of his Children ſhall be heirs to that immortality and Bleſſedneſs which he once was to enjoy in Paradiſe. Secondly, all his Children ſhall be blemiſhed and tainted to inherit the curſe of Baniſhment, miſery and mortality which he incurred. Thirdly, this corruption ſhall not be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, but by the extraordinary Mediation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in the ſight of God generally were as great ſinners as the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> but legally and morally. — <hi>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wiſe; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin:</hi> Yet jurally they were not ſuch ſinners, nor ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe they were not ſuch aliens and ſtrangers
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49664:188"/> from God, but had many reall rights and priviledges peculiar unto them, as the Peculiar People of God.</p>
                        <p>Yet the right which the <hi>Jew</hi> had in God was but a <hi>puerile</hi> or <hi>ſervile</hi> right, to be as Children in the condition of Servants, under age, in hardſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law: From which ſtate <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to emancipate and deliver them, that he might advance them and inveſt them into a filial right of being the Sons of God, In a plenage and fulneſs of years, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.2, 3.</p>
                        <p>Thus Men are ſinners three ſeveral waies: Moſt Men generally are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors and improbous or unkind: and all Men univerſally are calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, oppreſſed, blemiſhed, diſtreſſed, and tainted; wherefore this laſt way Man, as he is a Man, is a ſinner; and over and above legally and morally ſinful, being actually tranſgreſſors and improbous as well as ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally miſerable and calamitous; that is, oppreſſed, blemiſhed, diſtreſſed, and eſpecially tainted or corrupted from the womb.<note place="margin">

                                 <hi>Levi</hi> pay'd Tithes in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s loyns.</p>
                              <p>A token of ſubjection in the Father, which is derived to the Children. If the Head yielded, the Members muſt: So they pay'd Tithes virtually in their Father before they were born; but they muſt pay them actually in their own perſons and for themſelves, after they are born.</p>
                              <p>As heirs have rights to Honours and Eſtates in their Father's Honours and Eſtates, and alſo in their ſhames and Debts while they live; but after their death they enjoy the profits, and bear the burdens and ſhames of their Fathers.</p>
                              <p>How were our Perſons in <hi>Adam?</hi> Seminally, as the plant in the root and ſeed; potentially, not actually. But where were our Wills? even where our Souls were, with God that gives us them when he frames us in the womb.</p>
                              <p>Yet a Jural will we had in <hi>Adam,</hi> to have a right in him, and by him, or elſe a wrong: as people have in their Knights and Burgeſſes; who nevertheleſs have diſtinct wills for themſelves in other things, as they have, in whoſe wills for their election only their wills are included.</p>
                              <p>So <hi>Adam</hi> was for us all, to ſtand or fall for us all; not to do good or bad for us all: and now we muſt all ſuffer by him, though we did not act actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſin in him, but virtually.</p>
                              <p>We have the ſame natural Body, and inclinations thereof, as <hi>Adam</hi> had.</p>
                              <p>But as his Body and his inclinations were perſonal to himſelf; ſo our Bodies and our inclinations are perſonal to our ſelves.</p>
                              <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> in nature had been created a Child, he could not have ſinned, becauſe he as a Child could have no uſe of his will.</p>
                              <p>When I am born into the world, I cannot ſin in the world, till I come to the uſe of my reaſon and will in the world; how then could I ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was born, or had a being in the world, any more than as I was (as the fruit is in the winter) faſt aſleep in my cauſes? How then ſay ſome, we were ſinners before we were? and how indeed? not ſo as they mean, let them prove it if they can.</p>
                              <p>Corruption of Bodies is manifeſt, and ſo Health is by weak or ſtrong Progenitors. Diſeaſes and Health are much hereditary in Nature: but virtues or vices of Souls I could never apprehend any deſcent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:49664:189"/> of them from Parents to their Children. Eſtates Honours and Shames are convey'd and paſs upon poſterity; but not by the paſſage of Nature, but of Law.</p>
                              <p>We are all concluded by <hi>Adam</hi>'s will; yet how? If he had done good altogether, his goodneſs was perſonally his own; nor is it, or ever was, or ever will be ours, but we ſhould be the better for it. But being he did evil, his evil was perſonally his own; nor is it, or ever was, or ever will be ours; but we ſhall fare the worſe for it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged to do good, ſo are we.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Adam</hi> was not obliged to ſin, no more are we.</p>
                              <p>We are as free to good or bad as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were.</p>
                              <p>How is a Traitor's blood that runs in his veins, or his Son's blood tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? the Wiſe can tell.</p>
                              <p>We put a great ſtreſs upon many things, as upon this of Original ſin, and upon <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and upon <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> and of being born in ſin, and of the power of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> and of the Free-will, and of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs; as alſo of Predeſtination, Election, Reprobation, and of a Judg in matters of Faith, of Infallibility, and Univerſal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Hereſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It was the cuſtom then to ſpeak, yea think ſo, as they declare in theſe matters. Who can hinder or blame us juſtly for labouring to underſtand the meaning of theſe things, and not be abuſed as our Fathers were?</p>
                              <p>We all agree concerning theſe matters of Original ſin, Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Free-will, Imputed righteouſneſs, the real preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the waſhing of Baptiſm; but we cannot agree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner.</p>
                              <p>If we would leave quarrelling, and ſit ſtill, and conſider theſe points, we ſhould in time underſtand them ſufficiently by our own experience better than they do that diſpute of them daily.</p>

                              <p>Theſe three ſeveral ſinners, the Legal, the Moral and the Jural, are not three oppoſit ſorts of ſinners, ſo contradiſtinct that the one is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to the other; or that one ſenſe excludeth the reſt; but they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of ſinners, whereof the one may be without the other, and yet ſo conſiſtent, that they may all concurre in one and the ſame perſon. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a ſinner Jurally only, but no way Legally nor Morally. And <hi>Dives</hi> was a ſinner Morally only, not Legally; for we read not that he was a tranſgreſſor againſt the Law, nor Jurally, for he had great Poſſeſſions.</p>
                              <p>But in the ſight of God, Men are ſinners all three waies: Legally, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and Jurally, being tranſgreſſors againſt the Law, and offenders againſt Equity, and Aliens, Forreigners and Strangers to the rights, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and inheritances of the Kingdom of Heaven, whereto Man, as Man, and as the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> hath no right, intereſt or claim, but is born, and ſtands in the ſtate of a <hi>Quaſi</hi> treſpaſſer, and <hi>Quaſi</hi> ſinner.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Adam</hi> was created upright, <hi>i. e.</hi> not a tranſgreſſor Legally, nor a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſer Morally; and he was created an owner; for upon his creation, God gave him a humane right of Dominion over Fiſh, Foul and Beaſts.</p>
                              <p>But by virtue of his creation he had no Supernatural or Divine right; for he had no right to Paradiſe, and the Bleſſings thereof: For when <hi>Adam</hi> was created, Paradiſe was not yet planted; but after the creation of <hi>Adam</hi> follow'd the plantation of <hi>Eden,</hi> and God by putting <hi>Adam</hi> into <hi>Eden,</hi> did further juſtify him, for unto that right which was at firſt given him by Nature, God ſuperadded another right by Grace in ſetling and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in Paradiſe. And this right was hereditary to him and his heirs.</p>
                              <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> by his tranſgreſſion in offending againſt the Law of Paradiſe, made himſelf a tranſgreſſor, and all his heirs <hi>Quaſi</hi> treſpaſſers: For the puniſhment or curſe upon him for his tranſgreſſion, was his ejection and mortality; which ejection and mortality deſcended alſo to all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For according to God's Contract with <hi>Adam,</hi> and according to the rule of Equity and Reaſon, ſueing the Bleſſing, was hereditary to him and his heirs, therefore the curſe alſo became hereditary to him and his heirs.</p>
                              <p>This affliction of Man or his ejection from Paradiſe and his mortality, that now he is born to no divine inheritance, but is born an out-caſt from God's Bleſſing, born a mortal Creature, that muſt neceſſarily die; this is the condition that makes Man a <hi>Quaſi</hi>-treſpaſſer, and puts him into the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49664:193"/> ſtate of a Jural ſinner; and this <hi>Quaſi</hi>-treſpaſſer or Jural ſinner is the Man who in the next verſe ſhall be juſtified by the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For the Perſon who is the proper ſubject of Juſtification is Man conſidered as a Jural ſinnner, not excluding his legal or moral ſins, from which he is alſo juſtified; yet they unto his juſtifying are but accidental: for although legally and morally, he were never ſo righteous; yet unleſs he be juſtified he cannot be ſaved: for he is ſtill a Jural or <hi>Quaſi</hi> ſinner.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is not a ſinner actively by committing any act of ſin, as were the two former ſinners, who were offenders legally and morally, by acting againſt Law and Equity; but he is a ſinner paſſively by ſuffering that loſs or pain which is inflicted on him who is a ſinner actively.</p>
                              <p>For the Verb <hi>Sinning,</hi> is ſometimes put paſſively for ſuffering, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.39. <hi>That which was torn of Beaſts I brought not unto thee, I bare the loſs of it;</hi> where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is <hi>Chata, i. e.</hi> I ſinned for it.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Becauſe he is not a ſinner really, in whom ſin is inherent, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, to whom ſin is imputed, and who being innocent is reputed a delinquent, and put into the ſtate of a ſinner, that he may ſuffer that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which is the uſual puniſhment of a ſinner. As the Beaſts which the Law declared unclean, were not in themſelves unclean really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently, but imaginarily and putatively; for uncleanneſs was therefore imputed unto them, that they might be forborn as if they had been really unclean.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Becauſe the fact which conſtituteth a Man thus a <hi>Quaſi</hi>-ſinner to be miſerable and wretched, is no act of his own, but is either the act of ſome Law, which juſtly imputeth unto him that ſin, whereof ſome other is guilty, or is the act of ſome adverſary, who unjuſtly imputeth and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth upon him that ſin whereof he is not guilty, that he may ſuffer for it, as if he were guilty.</p>
                              <p>Hence the <hi>Quaſi</hi>-ſinner is termed by the Apoſtle a Conſtituted or Made-Sinner:<note place="margin">

                              <p>For in reſpect of the Tenſe, none of the Verbs in that verſe are of the Preterperfect Tenſe, but all Aoriſts and Indefinite. And ſeeing the two firſt are not rendred Preterperfectly thus, Sin hath entred, and death hath paſſed; but Indefinitely thus, Sin entred, and death paſſed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accordingly the Tranſlation had been more ſuitable, if the laſt Verb alſo had been rendred Indefinitely thus, For that (or in whom) all ſinned.</p>
                              <p>And in reſpect of the ſenſe, the words <hi>In whom all ſinned,</hi> carry the ſame ſenſe with thoſe, <hi>Through the offence of one many were made ſinners.</hi>

                              <p>That the difference between them in the concrete is not eſſential and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but accidental and contingent, for they are not ſo oppoſite and contrary, as that the word being taken in ſome one ſenſe, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exclude all the reſt; but the ſenſes of the word are only diverſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo different, that one ſenſe may be without the other; and yet ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, that they may all concur in the ſame word. For the word <hi>Sinner,</hi> doth carry ſometime only one of thoſe ſenſes, ſometime two, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time all three: and when the ſenſes are plural, ſometime they are equal, ſometime ſome one of them is more eminent; ſo that one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be a tranſgreſſor, improbous and calamitous.</p>

When we are Infants, we do not know that we are ſo, no more than the Tree doth that it groweth: we cannot diſcover what poyſon we brought with us into the World; but poyſon'd we are, and underſtand not how, nor in what: as it is the nature of ſome poyſon to have no ſenſible operation for ſome years, but breaks forth at laſt into ſwellings and putrified ſores, and not throughly purged to our lives end. In the dawnings and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of our Reaſon we underſtand little more than the rod and ſmart it bringeth with it: In our riper age our Blood runneth hot in our veins, then do we act over that with ſome ſenſe and feeling, which our Nurſe pratled unto us, and ſervants read to us with a licentious tongue and wanton behaviour in our Nonage, and expreſs thoſe Rudiments and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at laſt as perfectly, as thoſe old Gray-headed <hi>Atheiſts</hi> that taught them.</p>

                              <p>This was the beſt Crown wherewith our Mother crown'd us in the day of our Conception. She taught us from the beginning that we ſuckt it from her breaſts, as ſhe and all her Fathers had done before her, who were forced to ſin by a violent hand that firſt thruſt us into that deadly path. Indeed the Old Man, that old Sinner is glad to hear of another Old Man worſer than himſelf; although he never intend to crucify him, nor well underſtandeth what he is, no more than the vulgar do <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> or the Devil, God bleſs us; but that the one is a Beaſt that hath horns and hoofs, and the other ſawcer eyes and claws and a cloven foot.</p>

Some make it a Sin, ſome a puniſhment only, ſome make it both, ſome the want of original Righteouſneſs, ſome the habitual obliquity of the Will, others have made it the Image of the Devil. There be that conceive all the Faculties of the Soul and Body, even the whole Eſſence of Man to be corrupted, and a Maſs of evil molded up into a Man.

                              <p>And as we pretend Original Sin to be our driver into all other evils and calamities, ſo we pretend the want and inſufficiency of Grace, to ſave us; and as we know not what that monſter of Sin is, ſo we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the Beauty of God's Grace.</p>

Sometimes they repreſent it to be an infuſed Habit, ſometimes a Motion or operation, ſometimes they know not how to diſtinguiſh it from Faith and Charity, it is one and the ſame, and yet it is manifold; it exciteth and ſtirreth us up, it worketh in us, and it worketh with us, it goeth before us and it follows us.

                              <p>In all that I have written, I profeſs not to ſlight or jeer at that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weakneſs, or attainder of Sin and Death, which all of us have cauſe to bemoan; but my ſcope is to atteſt the Juſtice and Mercy of God who hath been made too much the author of Sin and Death.</p>
                              <p>And to ſatisfie the ignorant, that Sin is not entailed upon us, by fate or Blood, nor Grace neither, whether we will or no.</p>
                              <p>They have been too long made to believe, that Sin and Grace have been real infuſions and Phyſical operations from the evil and the Good Spirit, working ſenſible alterations in the Fleſh and Spirit without any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or operation of the Will of either. Upon this inevitable neceſſity of ſinning and damnation on the one hand, and of Grace and Salvation on the other hand, they are moved to lie ſtill under the one which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help, and wait for the other, if ever it be decreed to come, which they cannot call nor invite unto them.</p>
                              <p>The People are aſtoniſhed when they are told of their blindneſs, and lameneſs, and deadneſs to all good, and of the neceſſity of a real deſcenſion
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49664:195"/> of the Spirit into the Heart, which being ſtark blind and ſtone dead, is not able to know what is done unto it in the Reviving thereof, no not ſo much as to conſent to receive what ſhall be given it.</p>
                              <p>If Sin were inevitably decreed, and accordingly infuſed by the Devil into all Souls, beginning at <hi>Adam,</hi> it ſhould be non-ſenſe to define Sin to be a tranſgreſſion of the Law, and a covenant with Satan.</p>
                              <p>And if Grace were inevitably decreed, and accordingly poured by God into all Souls, beginning at <hi>Adam,</hi> it ſhould be non-ſenſe to define Grace to be an obedience to the Goſpel, and a covenant with God.</p>
                              <p>There was never yet any Covenant made without conſent of Wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both parties. The Devil and the Sinner are agreed, and God and the Godly are agreed alſo. And this Agreement muſt be free on both ſides; for a forc'd will is no will, nor can the will be forc'd either by God or Man: <hi>Nullum pertinaciae remedium poſuit Deus aut homo:</hi> There is no remedy againſt the obſtinacy of will either from God or Man.</p>
                              <p>God hath made in Man a Free-will, to work freely, neither can it work otherwiſe, neither will God deſtroy the work of his own hands, nor is there any reaſon but that Man ſhould be left to the liberty of his own will, for good or evil.</p>
                              <p>And if any thing be given from above to help the Gifts of Nature, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſo given, is given according to the capacity of the receiver: Nor is any thing given till it be received, nor can it be received till it be accepted, nor can it be accepted without a will, nor can it be a will without God, who hath given this will.</p>
                              <p>Who then can ſin and be damned againſt his will? and who can repent and be ſaved againſt his will? Damnation it ſelf cannot damn them that will not be damned, and Salvation it ſelf cannot ſave them that will not be ſaved. The Devil wills us to ſin, and we will it too: God wills us to repent, and we will it too. So comes Sin and Damnation, ſo comes Grace and Salvation. We cannot ſin, nor be damned without our ſelves; we cannot have Grace nor be ſaved without our ſelves.</p>
                              <p>There is ſhuffling and cutting in ſaying, God worketh the will ſweetly over to conſent, how then irreſiſtibly? and how comes the will to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but irreſiſtibly.</p>
                              <p>O Irreſiſtibility, Irreſiſtibility! thou takeſt away all Sin and all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe thou takeſt away all will to either; and there can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor bad without a will. O Irreſiſtibility, Irreſiſtibility! thou takeſt away all damnation and ſalvation, becauſe thou takeſt away all will to either; and there can be neither damnation nor ſalvation without a will: And ſo no puniſhment nor reward can be due to any.</p>
                              <p>And ſo all Rules and Laws are fooleries, and ſignifie nothing: So God ſhall be the author of Grace without or againſt the will, and give a Gift and no Gift: And the Devil by act, but God by purpoſe, ſhall be the author of ſin without and againſt the will, and force a ſin and no ſin.</p>
                              <p>I may ſuffer againſt my will, but I cannot ſin againſt my will.</p>
                              <p>I cannot do good againſt my will, nor can I be rewarded againſt my will. Theſe are ſuch neceſſary conſequential demonſtrations, as no body can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But ſome would if they could put out the eyes of all Men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind in themſelves, would have no body ſee; becauſe they want tails, would perſwade others to cut off theirs.</p>
                              <p>If God had not given Man a will, he had had no ſin, but now his ſin remaineth. If God had not given Man a Will, he had had no good; but
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49664:195"/> now his good remaineth. If God had not given a Man will, it had been very unreaſonable to bid him uſe what he never had: But now God hath given him a will, it is very reaſonable to bid him uſe what he hath. So God's wayes are very equal: Juſt and true are thy wayes, O King of Saints, and the Judg of all the World muſt needs do right.</p>
                              <p>He therefore that hath eyes to ſee, let him ſee, and he ſhall ſee more clearly: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear, and he ſhall hear more diſtinctly: He that hath a Heart to underſtand, let him underſtand, and he ſhall underſtand more profoundly: And he that hath a Will, let him will, and he ſhall will more freely.</p>

                              <p>It ſtriketh an awe into thoſe that ſcorn it.</p>
                              <p>A Man of God, a Magiſtrate carries ſuch gravity in his Countenance and habit, and Majeſty in his life and Calling, that his preſence will daunt the ſtouteſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and Ranters, and ſtop their oathes and lewdneſs, till <hi>Cato</hi> be gone: they ſtart at him, and beg of him to depart out of their coaſt, and pray him not to come among them to torment them. The preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> of Juſtice and Judgment made <hi>Felix</hi> tremble. <hi>Bonum tunc vincit cum laeditur, tunc intelligitur cum arguitur:</hi> When good is moſt oppoſed ſhe conquers moſt; and is then underſtood when ſhe is reproved, ſo hard a thing it is to looſe the Inſtinct of Nature, which when put by will come on with the greater force to our greater conviction and ſhame, in refuſing that good which is ſo obvious and eaſie to be practiſed, and hunt after that evil which is more remote and painful to be performed. <hi>Herod</hi> was troubled to cut of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s head, becauſe it was unjuſt and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable; yet for his Oath's ſake and thoſe that were with him, and to pleaſe a wanton Damſel, in Point of Honour falſely ſo called, he commanded it to be done, contrary to his conſcience, and was troubled after he had
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49664:197"/> done it, when hearing of the famous works of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he cryed out it was <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> that was riſen from the dead.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s innocency evicted <hi>Pilate</hi>'s heart, while his tongue condemned him, ſaying to the People; <hi>Be it as you require:</hi> And yet he could not but ſay, <hi>I find no fault in this Man.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The malice of Tyrants raged againſt the Martyrs to kill them, while their innocency acquitted them even in the Judgments of their murtherers, fain would they have ſpar'd their lives, if they would but conform to their idolatrous courſes ſo contrary to nature; for an Idol is nothing, there is no reaſon in Nature for it, nor in many other things, which unreaſonable and unnatural Men preſume to do. Wicked Men are glad when they can get companions in their ſins, and glory moſt when for fear of torments they can bring godly Men over to their ungodly courſes; thinking thereby to ſtrengthen themſelves in their ſin, and to ſalve their own ſores, and lull the loud cries of their conſcience condemning them for what they do. What Traitor ever praiſed Rebellion, and what Devil will not commend a Saint? Let me die the death of the Righteous, ſaith the moſt profane, and let my laſt end be like unto his; yet they will not give themſelves leave to do that which in reaſon they allow to be good and juſt; ſo ſtrongly are Men confuted by themſelves, and ſo powerful is the Law of Nature in all Men.</p>
                              <p>Beſides, what ſatisfaction ever had any wicked Man in his wicked courſes? Eat, drink and be merry, take thine eaſe; let looſe the reins to all licentiouſneſs, beat at every buſh, crown thy head with Roſe-buds before they be withered, taſte of all the delights of the Sons of Men; will this do? in the midſt of laughter the heart is ſorrowful: Vanity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, ſaith even Nature it ſelf, all is vanity and vexation of Spirit. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can fill the heart but God, nothing can comfort but a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                              <p>Laſtly, to make all ſure, remember that undeniable principle of Reaſon mentioned in the firſt Book and firſt Title of the firſt Volume, to be written with Letters of Gold, and to be engraven in the Rock with the point of a Diamond for ever, which is this; <hi>That every Action that is in our Power to do or not to do, is imputable to us, and may juſtly be imputed to us by God or Man: But on the contrary, every Action that is not in our power to do or not to do, is not imputable unto us, nor can be juſtly imputed to us by God or Man: That is, not of debt, to the hurt of any, but of Grace it may be imputed for their good.</hi>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>For favours may be imputed where they are not due: But ſins and plagues can never be imputed, but only where they are due.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Rule is unqueſtionable: It is impoſſible rightly to lay the guilt of ſin upon any Man, unleſs he by his own individual Act of will, hath made himſelf guilty of the tranſgreſſion of a known Law.</p>

                              <p n="2">2. Our Birth is involuntary, and without our knowledg: how then born in ſin involuntary and unknown, except God by decree included our knowledg and wills by interpretation? How can theſe things be? No being, no life, no Action, no Underſtanding, no Will. Then we muſt charge God, who makes us conſent before we were, or could conſent.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Our will was faſt aſleep in its cauſes. The cauſe of our will is God's will, not <hi>Adam</hi>'s will: The Soul is immediately created and infuſed by God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> was not in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. God did not puniſh the Devils but for their own moſt perfect choice: why are Men puniſhed for no choice.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. If <hi>Adam</hi> had notice of the Law, what notice had we? If <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch rare Rectitudes and helpes to keep the Law, what rectitudes or helpes had we?</p>
                              <p n="6">6. If we had any will in <hi>Adam,</hi> it muſt be free or not free; if no will, how involved in his ſin? if a Free-will, why involved in his will? if not free, how guilty?</p>

                              <p n="8">8. If <hi>Adam</hi> loſt his knowledg and will, why was he as God knowing good and evil, and ſhut out of Paradiſe, leaſt he ſhould chooſe the Tree of Life, as he had done the Tree of Knowledg?</p>

                           <p>While I am thus deeply engaged in this great and conſiderable Buſineſs of Jural Righteouſneſs, which is the principal vein that runs through this whole Diſcourſe of Juſtification, to the Inheritance of God's Teſtament: And as the clue that guides through all the Labyrinth thereof, I think it neceſſary beſides all theſe proofs to add the beſt reaſons I can to fortify this cauſe.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Right. Reaſon.</note>1. The matter whereunto a Man is juſtified is ſome Right, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Moral Righteouſneſs; for that is a virtue, and is not deviſeable to be convey'd as Rights are to any by gift or otherwiſe; nor can Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities deſcend to any by ſucceſſion.</p>
                           <p>No Man was ever able to bequeath his Wiſdom or Goodneſs to another from himſelf, in his life time, neither did any Son or Heir inherit his Father's Mental perfections, as he may his corporal likeneſs or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or his Honour and Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>A Right is an incorporeal thing, belonging to ſome Dignities or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and Men attain to them ſeveral waies, by Birth, or Gift, or labour.</p>
                           <p>This Right of Juſtification comes not by Birth, nor yet by Work; but by Gift or Grace.<note place="margin">

The labourer and believer agree in this, that both have a Right or claim, the labourer to his Wages, the Believer to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but they differ in this, the labourer hath a Right of Debt to his Wages by the title of his work that earned them, the Believer hath a Right of Grace to his Promiſe by the Title of his Faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49664:200"/> Seal of the righteouſneſs of his Faith. Now, a Seal cannot be of any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Righteouſneſs, but of a Jural Right or Intereſt to ſome Eſtate of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or Profit.</p>
                           <p>A Seal fixed upon a Cabinet or parcel of Goods or upon an Inſtrument, is a ſign of the Right which the owner hath, that none but he can challenge any of thoſe Goods contained or expreſſed in thoſe veſſels or Writings.</p>
                           <p>The Right ſealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> is, that he might be the Father of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which is a Jural Right of Dignity, and that he might be the heir of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is a Jural Right of propriety:<note place="margin">

                           </p>
                           <p>Both theſe ſayings carry the ſame meaning, that the Right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is by promiſe, not by Law.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon of this reaſon is, becauſe every inheritance is a right, though every right be not an inheritance.

                           <p>And again, both theſe ſayings as Premiſſes infer the ſame concluſion, That a Man is not juſtified by the Law proved <hi>ab abſurdo;</hi> for if a Man be juſtified, or if his Right of inheritance be by the Law, then the Grace of God is fruſtrate, Faith is fruſtrate, and the death of Chriſt fruſtrate, and the Promiſe fruſtrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Thus our juſtification makes no moral alteration in us; that is, makes us not juſt or righteous in doing moral righteouſneſs, much leſs does mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral righteouſneſs juſtifie; but juſtification produceth in us a civil capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to poſſeſs ſomething, inveſting us in an Eſtate, and gives us a new right to have and hold ſomething as our own. The poor oppreſſed are juſtified, not by making them morally righteous, but by giving them right; that is, either declaring their right by a right Sentence, or by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of that force and fraud, which would deprive them of their right.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Bondage.</note>There are two Spiritual States; the one of bondage, the other of freedom.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Spiritual Bondage, which is a Reſtraint, Preſſure, Cloſeneſs, or Faſtneſs of the Spirit whereby a man is tyed from good to evil, is a drudge to ſin, and a ſlave to luſt, a captive to the Devil. This is a State of wrath, low, baſe, terrene and miſerable; a condition below the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a man having no Right nor capacity of Right to any Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; a very death.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Freedom.</note>2. Spiritual Freedome, which is a gallantry, fluency, clearneſs, or looſneſs of the Spirit, an enlargement from evil to good; a licenſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do a mans own Will, or rather a better will, even the Will and pleaſure of God: This is a State of Grace, an high, noble and bleſſed condition tranſcending the proper nature and quality of man</p>

                        <div n="5" type="section">

                              <note place="margin">Burden.</note>1. Now the State from which a man is juſtified, is the baſe condition of Spiritual Bondage, and the miſeries conſequent thereunto. This is the Terme of receſse, or <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> from whence Iuſtification commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a great Burden.</p>
                           <p>A Burden vulgarly ſignifies a heavy weight, but legally it ſignifies ſome Charge, Penalty, Diſability or Service. Hence <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls Gods Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Burdens, as the Burden of <hi>Babylon, Egypt, Damaſcus. &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In all kingdomes there are Burdens; as Infamy is a Burden of Diſgrace reſtraining a man from all Honours and Offices; as Outlary is a Burden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining a man from the benefit of Law, hindring a man from being Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and having audience in a Court of Iuſtice; to be a Stranger and Alien is a Burden hindring a man from purchaſing, or poſſeſſing Lands of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
                           <p>In all families there are Burdens, as Baſtardy is a Burden of Diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance laid upon a child unlawfully begotten; Slavery is a Burden of Bondage laid upon ſome ſervant, hindring him from getting, poſſeſſing or ſuing for any thing; Divorce is a Burden of Expulſion laid upon a Wife diſloial, hindring her from the Society of bed and board, and marrying to another man.</p>
                           <p>Thus in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſuſtained the Burden of Baſtardy and <hi>Hagar</hi> the Burden of Slavery; hence <hi>Sarah</hi> required of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he would diſinherit <hi>Iſhmael,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Gen. 21.10.</note> and be divorced from <hi>Hagar. —Caſt out this Bondwoman and her ſon, for the ſon of the Bondwoman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the Freewoman.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſtate to which a man is Juſtified, is the ſtately condition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual freedome, and the miſeries conſequent thereunto. This is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> to which we are advanced; As Bondage was <hi>Capitis Diminutio,</hi> the leſſening of the head, or Degrading of a man So Freedome is the <hi>Capitis Exaltatio,</hi> or the raiſing or lifting up the head of a man, or advancing of a man.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Gen. 40.20. 2 King. 25.27.</note>As the heads of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cheif Butler and Baker were lifted up, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakin</hi>'s head was lifted up out of Priſon by <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This ſtate of Divine Freedome drawes into it Forgiveneſs of ſins, Reſurrection from the dead, and Life everlaſting.</p>
                           <pb n="361" facs="tcp:49664:204"/>
                           <p>Thus the Term or Bound of Receſs from which we are juſtified is ſome Burden, and the Term or Bound of Acceſs to which we are juſtified is ſome Right.</p>
                           <p>A Right vulgarly is a thing which is true, and good, and honeſt; but legally it is a thing which is due to have and to hold ſome benefit and good which the Law owes us and ſettles upon us: This is oppoſed to ſome burden, Penalty or Charge which ſignifies to have and to hold ſome ſufferance or grievance which the Law owes us and ſettles upon us.</p>

                           <p>There are in the world many Corporations where diverſe perſons are united into one body. And in theſe Corporations there are diverſe Rights,<note place="margin">Corporation.</note> ſome of them are Burdens and ſome Benefits, as in a Kingdom there are Rights of Liberty to be a free-man born, or to be made free; to be a Member of ſome Corporation, to have ſuffrage or vote in Elections, to be heir in a Family, to ſucceed to the Inheritance and Honour, to be a Judg to give Judgment and to do Juſtice. The burdens contrary to theſe are Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that deprives a man of Liberty, Baniſhment that deprives of ſome Corporation, Baſtardy that deprives a man of his family, Infamy that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives a man of Honour and Preferment: For the true rule is, though not kept in the world, <hi>Portae dignitatum non patent infamibus Perſonis,</hi> The Gates of Honour are faſt ſhut againſt ſcandalous Perſons.</p>
                           <p>In a Family there are diverſe Rights; as Matrimony, a ſtate of Right whereby the Husband and the Wife have Right to each others bodies. —<hi>The Wife hath not power</hi> (or Right) <hi>over her own body but the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.4.</note> 
                              <hi>and the Huſband hath not power</hi> (or Right) <hi>over his own body but the Wife;</hi> For each have given to other a power or Right over their bodies reſpectively, Primogeniture is the Right to ſucceed to the Inheritance of the Father under the Law. Cleanneſs was a State of Right to enter into the Congregation and to partake of the Sacrifice, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery is a Right to preach the Word and apply the Sacraments.</p>
                           <p>The Husband and Wife are no more two but one Fleſh, more united than the Father and Son, For, for the cauſe of a Wife, the Son ſhall leave his Father and Mother and ſhall cleave to his Wife and they two ſhall be one Fleſh; they are partakers of all Rights together: The good and evil of the Husband is the good and evil of the Wife, and the good and evil of the Wife is the good and evil of the Husband; his Honour and Wealth is hers, and her Honour and Wealth is his; if he ſuffers ſhe ſuffers, if he proſper ſhe rejoyceth.</p>
                           <p>The King and his Subjects are one Body: The Honour and Welfare of the King is the Honour and Welfare of the Subjects, and the Honour and Welfare of the Subjects is the Honour and Welfare of the King; his wrong is theirs and their wrong is his.</p>
                           <p>The Church is a Corporation in which Chriſt and his Subjects or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are one Body; they are Members of his fleſh and of his bones.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> Chriſt and the Faithful are more united than Man and Wife; for Man and Wife are but one Fleſh, but Chriſt and the Faithful are one Spirit. A man for Chriſt his ſake muſt forſake Father and Mother, Wife and Children; and he that doth ſo ſhall receive an hundred fold, and in the end everlaſting life: The honour of Chriſt is the honour of the Faithful, and the honour of the Faithful is the honour of Chriſt, and the welfare of one is the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the other, and <hi>è contra.</hi> Chriſt is a Party in all the conditions of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49664:205"/> his Subjects. —<hi>Saul, Saul why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> All charity that is done to them is done to Chriſt. —<hi>In as much as ye have done it to the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me; and in as much as ye have not done it to one of theſe little ones, ye have not done it to me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus he whoſe Right is created, that had none before, is juſtified: And he whoſe Right is reſtored that had Right but loſt it, is juſtified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it again.</p>
                           <p>All reſtitution is juſtification, all in-lawing is juſtification; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Party outlawed is reſtored to the Benefit of the Law.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Other Names.</note>There are other Names of the ſame thing, or other Words whereby the nature of juſtification is farther illuſtrated.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As by ſuch words which do create or conſtitute a Right, as Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Grace, Gift, Good-will, Will, Teſtament, Covenant and Promiſe, all which are Jural Words ſignifying the cauſes of our Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As by ſuch words which do confirm or aſſure a Right, as Seal, Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; for the holy Spirit is the Seal and Earneſt of that inheritance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are Juſtified, as Liberty, Freedom, Communion, Fellowſhip, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, Gift, Grace, Inheritance, Poſſeſſion, Glory, all which and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are the reſults and effects of our Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. As by ſuch words as are oppoſite to Juſtifying, as injuring, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, outlawing, reprobating: As to be injured is againſt law to loſe ſome right which by law was due, and to be condemned is according to law to loſe ſome right which by law was to be loſt, and to be outlawed is to loſe all benefit of Law, which the perſon in-lawed had; ſo a Perſon juſtified is one, who beyond and above all Law is made to have ſome right which before he had not, or which by Law he could never have; or one who by, or according to Law is made to have and hold ſome right which by Law was due to him being inlawed. And as condemnation and outlawing is the imputation of a preſent Sin to a future puniſhment: So juſtification and inlawing is the imputation of a preſent right to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſing; and imputation is a <hi>Genus</hi> to them both.</p>
                           <p>Seeing then injuring and condemning and outlawing are jural words, therefore juſtifying, acquitting and inlawing are jural words alſo.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. As by ſuch words which are of affinity and nearneſs, and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to juſtifying, and comprehended under it; As Naturalizing, Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, Manumizing, Redeeming, Pardoning, Adopting, and ſuch like, which are the ſeveral kinds of juſtifying, which is the Genus to them all.</p>
                           <p>For Naturalizing is a juſtifying of an Alien born in a far Country, by imputing to him the right of a Native or home-born. As Legitimating is the Juſtifying of a Baſtard, by imputing the right of a lawful birth to him that was unlawfully born. As Manumizing or Enfranchizing is the Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Villain or Bondman by imputing the right of freedom to him that was born a Slave. As Emancipating is the Juſtifying of a Minor, by giving right of Livery to him that was under Guardians. As Ranſoming or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming is the Juſtifying of a Captive, by imputing the right of Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him who before was a Priſoner. As Pardoning is the Juſtifying of a Malefactor, by imputing the right of indempnity to him who before was condemned. As Adopting is the Juſtifying of a Son and Heir of another Family, by imputing the right of a Son and Heir to him that hath no Son nor Heir of his own Family.</p>
                           <pb n="363" facs="tcp:49664:205"/>
                           <p>All theſe are juſtifying, eſpecially when an Alien, a Baſtard, a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave, a Captive, and more eſpecially when a Rebel or Malefactor is made the Son and Heir of a Kingdom, without any ſuit, mediation or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; this is exceeding gracious, becauſe it paſſeth from one extream to another meerly upon the Donors kindneſs and pure love. And ſuch is our Juſtification, as by this Treatiſe hath, and will hereafter be demonſtrated.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. As by words of Attribute whereby the juſtified ones are called in Scripture as Sons and Heirs of God, and Co-heirs with <hi>Chriſt: —Thou art no more a Servant, but a Son and an Heir of God through Chriſt.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">

                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19.</note> 
                              <hi>and of the houſhold of God, as the Lords Free-men, —For he that is called in the Lord being a Servant, is the Lords Free-man.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This laſt word <hi>Free-man</hi> comprehends under it all the former: For Freedom is the original and fundamental Right, without which a Man is dead in Law, and hath no Will nor capacity to ſue for, or poſſeſs any Right.</p>
                           <p>And theſe two words <hi>Free-man</hi> and <hi>Juſtified,</hi> are <hi>adequate</hi> and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal to denote the ſame Perſon. A Free-man is a Perſon juſtified to have ſome right, being abſolutely oppoſed to a Bond-man, who is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon condemned to have no right at all; and ſo to an Alien or Stranger, and to a Baſtard or Priſoner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Hence the word Juſtified is put for Freed: —<hi>By Chriſt all that believe are juſtified</hi> (i. e. freed) <hi>from all thoſe things,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">

                              <hi>from which we could not be juſtified</hi> (or freed) <hi>by the Law of Moſes.</hi> And ſometimes is tranſlated by the word Freed, —<hi>He that is dead is freed,</hi> i. e. <hi>juſtified from ſin.</hi>

                              <hi>Juſtifying</hi> is not only a Jural word, but a <hi>Curial</hi> word, or Court word; not of a Court contentious in which <hi>Jus dicitur,</hi> in Suits, by declaring the Law, and pronouncing the Sentence according to Law; as in <hi>England</hi> is done in the Courts of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> where the Judges repreſent the King for his Juſtice. But rather of a Court of Grace and Favour, <hi>ubi jus fit &amp; datur,</hi> in Suits voluntary, and where the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is the Decree of the Supreme Judge in equity and love; in which that right which was not in Being before, is made to be, according to the kindneſs and good will of the Prince, wherein the iniquities and rigours of the Law are rectified according to conſcience, by the <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> to the King, and Pardons for offences are granted by the King, and Patents for Honours, Profits, and Priviledges are beſtow'd above and contrary to the Letter of the Law: As in <hi>England</hi> in the Courts of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> and <hi>Chancery,</hi> where the Perſons preſident are not called Judges, but by other Names, as <hi>Maſters of Requeſts,</hi> and <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and do repreſent the King for his Mercy and Grace.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Juſtifying is a Teſtamentary word of the ſame nature with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or ordaining of an Heir, or the deviſing of a Legacy. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in a Teſtament is inſtituted as an Heir or ordained a Legatary, that Perſon is juſtified or made to have a right to that inheritance or Legacy.</p>
                           <p>The co-incidence of theſe two words is the more proper; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Juſtification is a moſt gracious act, proceeding from the free Grace of God, ſpontaneouſly granted to thoſe that never ſought it, nor none for them: As commonly Inſtitutions and Devices are made in Wills and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49664:206"/> Teſtaments, eſpecially <hi>ad pias cauſas;</hi> which are, and others ſhould be acts of Mercy and meer Grace: but chiefly becauſe Juſtification is a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary act of God, ariſing from his laſt Will and Teſtament, wherein all Believers are inſtituted and ordained his Heirs to the Inheritance of Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                           <p>By this Teſtamentary act of God in juſtifying Sinners, it appears, that as a Man is legally Righteous according to Law, and morally Righteous above the Law, and jurally Righteous as a proprietary and owner: So God is much more eminently and tranſcendently righteous all theſe waies, but not ſo properly legally (becauſe he is the maker of Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above them) as morally righteous or gracious, and jurally righteous, or an owner of all things: to make Man not only legally righteous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, and morally righteous according to Law, but jurally righteous according to free Grace.</p>

                           <p>The power or product is the effect of two numbers rightly multiplied, when one of thoſe two is the root of that power, and the other is the rate between the root and the power.</p>
                           <p>As 6 is the cauſe of 12, and 12 is the effect of that cauſe, and the root 2 multiplying 6 is the means between the cauſe and the effect producing the effect 12.</p>
                           <p>So the cauſe of Salvation is God's promiſe.</p>

                           <p>So that to account is to conclude by reaſoning or numbring, by arguing to find the concluſion, by addition to find the total, by multiplication the product, and by diviſion the Quotient.</p>
                           <p>The Grammatical ſenſe of the word <hi>Impute,</hi> is to cut, divide, purge, or

                           <p>Imputation therefore that is accounting or reckoning, is a Spiritual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the conveyance of rights, which are Spiritual things belonging to corporeal things: Which rights are jural belonging to Perſons, and may be paſſed over from one to another, by donation, ſucceſſion, ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or dereliction, deputation or aſſignment, degradation or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                           <p>Now, for a Man to be clothed with the Robes of this Righteouſneſs, as they ſpeak, is to appear before God not in the habit of a righteous and juſtified Man, but of the juſtifier of the Sons of Men: whoſe righteouſneſs is too excellent and glorious for our condition, of a Mediator God and Man!</p>

                           <p>The Members partake of the benefit of the Head: The Wife is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd by Marriage with all her Husband's goods, but the virtue of the Head is not appropriated though communicated, nor made over to the Members, nor is the eſtate of the Husband paſt away or made over to his Wife.

                           <p>The Eſtate, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s; but the benefit of them and of all that is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, is ours; as is the Wealth, and Wiſdom, and Honour of the Husband to the Wife. In a word,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is that for which Faith is accounted to us for Righteouſneſs; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Perſonal righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is not accounted to us.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Becauſe Perſonal moral virtues cannot be paſt over to others by act of Nature or Law, as by Deſcent, Donation, Succeſſion, Ceſſion,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49664:208"/> Dereliction, Degradation, Deprivation, or any other way or means. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are inherent habits of the Mind, and therefore inſeparable from the Mind; and if ſeparable, altogether inconveyable to the Mind of another, by deed of gift, Deſcent of Blood or any other conveyance whatſoever, during life, or after death.</p>
                           <p>But Jural Rights are of that nature, as that they may be derived by act of Law, not Nature, from Parents to their Children, from Predeceſſors to their Succeſſors, or Alienated from the Proprietary to any other Perſon; not only to be reckoned, but to be really his or theirs, to whom the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, reverſion, or derivation is made by any act or deed according unto Law, to take place in life, or after death. Alſo ſome act of mine may be accounted for a right to my ſelf; as my labour for my wages, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for my Eſtate, my Faith for my juſtification.</p>
                           <p>Thus Moral Righteouſneſs is inſeparable from the Perſon to which it doth belong, and cannot be reckoned to another; but Jural Rights are ſeparable, and may be accounted to another. I may poſſibly be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſaved for another's Virtue and Worth, but his Virtue and Worth can no waies be made mine.</p>
                           <p>Virtue, Learning, Vice and Ignorance are habits and qualities, which are a Man's own without accounting; but Riches and Honours we have as rights accounted unto us, or elſe we cannot have or hold them.</p>
                           <p>My Health or Sickneſs of Body may be propagated to me, and from me to another; but not the Health or Sickneſs of my Soul.</p>
                           <p>Who can be healthy by another Man's health while he poſſeſſeth it? Who can be ſick by another Man's ſickneſs while he poſſeſſeth it? Who can be rich by another Man's riches while he enjoyeth them? Who can be honourable by another Man's honour while he enjoyes it? Who can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by another Man's diſgrace while he ſuffereth it? Who can be poor by another Man's poverty while he endures it? Who can be learned by another Man's Learning while he hath it? Who can be virtuous by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's virtues, or vicious by another Man's vice? Theſe Virtues, or Vices are really his who hath them, not really mine whoſe they are not; or how can theſe things in another be ſo much as reckoned or accounted to be mine?</p>
                           <p>I may be reckoned guilty of another Man's ſin, and ſo of his puniſhment by conſenting or helping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not for his acting or ſuffering. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reckoned virtuous by another Man's virtue, or ſinful by another Man's ſin, or miſerable by another Man's miſery.</p>
                           <p>If I have many virtues, others may have as many virtues or more than I, and I have no leſs than I have: but if I have many rights to ſuch or ſuch things, others can have no rights to the ſame things. If they be taken away from me in part, I have the leſs; if in full, I have none at all: but others have them more. My virtues or vices can no Man have but my ſelf, but others may have the like: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Individual Rights can be reckoned to another Perſon, but ſpecifical only. The particular right to ſuch a place, Dignity or Profit, may be taken away from one Man, and given to another; but if it belong not to a Place, but to a Perſon only, then the ſpecifical right of one may be taken away from him, and given to another Man. No reckoning or accounting any thing to any Man but rights, Faith is accounted, and Right is accounted; Faith for Right, and Right for Faith. The righteouſneſs of the Law is not imputable or transferrible to another: —<hi>But the Man that doth them ſhall live in them,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12.</note> and no other. And
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:49664:208"/> the unrighteouſneſs of the Law is not imputable or derivable to another; but the Man that doth them ſhall die in them: for the Soul that doth well, that Soul ſhall live; but the Soul that ſins, that Soul ſhall die.</p>
                           <p>If it be objected, that we are united with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore all that is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s is ours: I anſwer, It is all for us, and our union with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our capacity to have a righteouſneſs imputed to us from <hi>Chriſt</hi> by our Faith in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore was <hi>Chriſt</hi> united unto us, that we might be united unto him.

Which righteouſneſs, though it be not exact coming up to the perfection of the Law, yet it is accepted for exact, in and through the perfection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Here is ſtill no imputation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Perſonal righteouſneſs to be found given out and beſtowed upon us, but an imputation of righteouſneſs by Faith, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> his righteouſneſs ſake, not our own. We are accounted righteous before God, ſaith our Church:<note n="*" place="margin">See the 11. Artic. of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> That is, the merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs hath ſo far prevailed with God in our behalf, that by and upon our Faith we ſhall be accounted righteous before God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by our Faith; which in it ſelf and by it ſelf juſtifies not, but inſtrumentally and as the means of juſtification.</p>
                           <p>So God looks not upon a juſtified Perſon, as if he had done and ſuffer'd ſufficient to juſtifie him, but upon <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the juſtified in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who did and ſuffered ſufficiently for him.</p>
                           <p>It appears on all hands that there is ſuch a thing as Imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but at no hand is there found any agreement what this ſhould be.</p>
                           <p>'Tis true that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs is imputed to us, but not as they mean, who in a popular pleaſing phraſe tell us, That we put of the rags of the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> and put on the rich Robes of the New; that we are clothed with garments of our Elder Brother, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was with <hi>Eſau</hi>'s, that we as he may ſteal away the Bleſſing. What dint of argument will ſuch
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49664:209"/> weak ſayings endure? So the Adulterer may ſay he is chaſt with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s chaſtity; the intemperate, ſober with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s temperance; the Rebel, obedient with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s obedience; the malicious, loving with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s love; and every wicked Perſon, righteous with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs.</p>
                           <p>May it not as well be ſaid, That as we are holy with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s holineſs, ſo we are redeemers with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s redemption? for he who is ſaid to be our righteouſneſs, is as much ſaid to be our redemption.</p>
                           <p>Many ſtrange and dangerous conſequences may iſſue from ſuch imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they fancy. If any eye can pierce farther into the Letter, and find more than Imputation of Faith, for Righteouſneſs, and not Imputation of ſins for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs ſake, let him follow it as he pleaſes; ſo it be not to diſhonour <hi>Chriſt</hi> and cheat his own Soul, by taking no care to be any thing that is good, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is all in all unto him, not fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo much as a mite into the <hi>Treaſury</hi> of Holineſs, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath poured in that Vaſt Talent, which at the laſt day he accounts of his own Head, ſhall be reckoned to him as his own proper goods, to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes.</p>
                           <p>The better to fix the true ſenſe of Imputation in our minds, we muſt know, That Imputation is a <hi>Genus</hi> to theſe three things, Juſtification, Condemnation and Oppreſſion, which, how different ſoever and oppoſite they are among themſelves, yet they all agree in this one common general that they are an imputation whereby ſome good or evil is aſcribed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and imputed to us.</p>
                           <p>For Condemnation is an imputation of that puniſhment to a Man, which he hath deſerved by Law.</p>
                           <p>Oppreſſion is an imputation of that puniſhment, which he hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Law: And Juſtification is an imputation of that benefit which he hath deſerved by Law, or not deſerved by grace and favour.</p>
                           <p>And beſides we have no word whereby to expreſs our owning of any thing that is ours, but this of Imputation. Hence ſin is imputed to us, becauſe it is properly our own, as we have made it by our evil will; and puniſhment is ſaid to be ours, becauſe by our ſin it is juſtly imputed to us. And Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, becauſe it is made ours by the good will of the Imputer that beſtows it, and our own good will who accept it.</p>
                           <p>The want of this diſtinction makes many run aſide, firſt into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and then into contention; but the clear underſtanding and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof ſettles the controverſie into peace and quietneſs.</p>
                           <p>So Righteouſneſs is imputed, and Sin is imputed. and Reward is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and puniſhment is imputed; ſo Works are imputed for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and for a Reward of debt; and Faith is imputed for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for a Reward of Grace.</p>
                           <p>In a word, as for imputation of ſin it comes by the Law through works, and for imputation of Righteouſneſs, it comes by the Goſpel through Faith. The Law curſes and condemns the Sinner, the Goſpel bleſſes and juſtifies the ungodly. No Law was ever made to juſtifie, that muſt be grace; nor Grace was ever made to condemn, that muſt be Law. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s yoke is intolerable for condemnation to death; <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s yoke is eaſie for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Life.</p>

                        <p>THe matter of Juſtification is Rights.</p>
                        <p>A Right is whereby ſome benefit is made ours.<note place="margin">Matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Right.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a difference between Right and Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>Righteouſneſs is a moral word ſignifying a virtue or habit to do that good and right which Law preſcribes; and it is oppoſed to unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſinfulneſs, which is a vice and habit of doing that evil and wrong which Law forbids.</p>
                        <p>But Right is a Jural word, ſignifying the having, holding and enjoying of ſome benefit and good, which ſome Law ſettles upon us, and makes to be ours. And this is oppoſed to a Burthen or charge, ſignifying the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, holding and ſuffering of ſome grievance and evil, which ſome Law alſo ſettles upon us and makes ours.</p>
                        <p>In every Kingdom there are diverſe rights, as the right of Liberty to be a Free-man, a Member of a Corporation, of ſuffrage to have a voice in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, of Family to ſucceed to an Inheritance, of Honour to have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency and take place, of Power to give Judgment and do juſtice, of Office to perform ſome function and ſervice, of Benefice to have and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſome profits; and generally all Capacities, Abilities, Augmentations, Honours, Degrees, Rewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Benefits and Rights.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo in every Kingdom diverſe wrongs and burthens, quite contrary and privative to thoſe: As the burthen of ſlavery that deprives a Man of liberty, of Baniſhment that deprives a Man of ſome Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Baſtardy that deprives him of his Family, of Infamy that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives him of Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and generally all Incapacities, Diſabilities, Diminutions, Degradations and Penalties, are Burthens and Wrongs.</p>
                        <p>In every Family there are diverſe Rights: Matrimony a ſtate of right, whereby the Husband and the Wife have a right to each others Bed and Board, and over each others Bodies, Children and Eſtates.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4.</note> Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a ſtate of right to ſucceed to the whole inheritance of the Father.</p>
                        <p>Cleanneſs was a ſtate of right to enter into the Congregation, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Sacrifice. Miniſtery a ſtate of right to preach the word, and apply the Sacraments; Righteouſneſs in Scripture many times is put for a right: As <hi>Abraham believed in God,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                           <hi>and it was accounted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49664:210"/> i. e.</hi> for a right: For God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a Bleſſing, that <hi>Eliezer</hi> his ſervant ſhould not be his heir, but that he ſhould have a Son and Heir of his own Body, and that his Seed ſhould be as the ſtars of Heaven for multitude. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in God for this Promiſe and Bleſſing, and his Faith was counted for righteouſneſs, or gave him a right and title to this Bleſſing. Had not <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, <hi>i. e.</hi> had he not accepted of God's promiſe, God's promiſe had been a dead offer to him, and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had had no right at all unto it. But his Faith, <hi>i e.</hi> his acceptance of the promiſe gave him a right to claim and enjoy the Bleſſing.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Abraham</hi> received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the right of Faith; for Seals are not ſigns of moral righteouſneſs, but of jural rights, for Seals are put to conveyances and evidences, and other writings to teſtifie matters of right: So by Circumciſion he had now God's Seal to that Grant which God had formerly made to him. And <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that Abraham ſhould be the heir of the World, was not to him through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith; i. e.</hi> through the right by faith. That is, the right of inheritance promiſed came not to him by any right that the Law gave him, but by the right which his faith gave him.</p>

                           <p>He whoſe right is declared is juſtified, the Judg juſtifies the party whoſe right was controverted and doubtful.</p>
                           <p>The Matter of right the Judg creates not, but only declares what was concealed.</p>

                        <p>But when thou haſt leſs evil than thou deſerveſt, and art not puniſhed ſo much as thy ſin requireth, then thou haſt Grace.

                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a right to the Freedom, and that right came by Law, for it was his due by birth: <hi>I was free born,</hi> ſaith he.

                           <p>So the Titles whereby Men generally acquire and procure thoſe rights they enjoy, are two, either by Law or by Grace.<note place="margin">Titles.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Some Men have their Title by Law. When thou haſt evil that is due unto thee, juſt ſo much as thy ſin requires, there the Title whereby the Magiſtrate doth puniſh thee, is by Law; for all puniſhment is by Law. The ſtrength of ſin is the Law, ſaith St. <hi>Paul; i. e.</hi> all the Title and power that ſin hath to puniſh, is by virtue of the Law. Contrarily when thou haſt that good that is due unto thee, juſt in the meaſure whereby it is due, then alſo thy Title is by Law, becauſe all dues muſt come by Law; for where there is no Law, there is no ſin; ſo where there is no Law, there is nothing due.</p>
                           <p>And Title by Law is commonly threefold: Either by Birth, or by Purchaſe, or by Works. For the Law doth convey and ſettle rights upon us, either upon our Birth, or our Purchaſe, or our Works. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a right to the Freedom of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that right came by Title of Law; for it was his due, and the Law whereby it was due was his Birth.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lyſias</hi> the Chief Captain had the ſame right, for he alſo was Free of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Title was by Law, for it was his due, and the Law whereby it was due was his Purchaſe. <hi>Jacob</hi> had a right to <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> and his Title was by Law, for they were his due, and the Law whereby they were due was his Work and Service, for he had ſerved <hi>Laban</hi> fourteen years for them.</p>
                           <p>Some have a Title by Grace. When thou haſt more good than is due unto thee, or when none at all is due, then thou haſt Grace; and when thou haſt much good done thee when thou deſerveſt much evil, there Grace is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49664:215"/> exceeding gracious. Such Grace had <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Such Grace hath the incumbent to his living, If a Woman ſeized in Fee-ſimple marry, have Iſſue and die, the Husband living, that Husband hath a right of Free-hold in her Eſtate; yet this Title to that Eſtate is no way by Law, neither by Birth, Purchaſe, Marriage or Works, but only by Grace, or as the Lawyers term it, by the Courteſie of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For farther illuſtration; The Titles whereby Men enjoy their Right may be reckoned four: By Birth, Purchaſe, Deſert or Favour.</p>

For Pardon is above Law, the Law hath no power to pardon, but is altogether againſt it, and where the party is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the Law is all for ſpeedy execution; but Pardon is of Grace, and that Grace is not againſt the Law, but above it: for God's Pardon comes from God's Prerogative.</p>

Gods kingdom is an elective kingdom,<note place="margin">Election.</note> not on God's part but on ours that are his ſubjects; for in being ſubjects of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom we are called God's Elect, and Gods choſen, becauſe we come into that kingdom by election and choice.</p>
                           <p>Now all Rights that ariſe from election come to the party elected by no other means on his part, but by his Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his conſent to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and by acceptance of that Right whereto he was elected.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Saul</hi> had a Right to be King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was juſtified to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49664:218"/> to which Right his title was by grace; for God had choſen him to that office, and cauſed the people to chooſe him by lot: So his title was by grace of election, on Gods part; but the means on <hi>Sauls</hi> part whereby this Right was applied unto him, was his Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> his conſent to the election, and his acceptance of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>The like may be ſaid of King <hi>David,</hi> his title alſo was by grace of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and the means on his part was his Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> his conſent to God's election, his acceptance of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>The like of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples, who had a Right to their office of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip, to which their title on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s part was by grace of election, for he had choſen them, and the means on their part was, their Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> their conſent to the election and acceptance of the office, when upon his calling of them, they aroſe and followed him.</p>
                           <p>Hence the infidelity and unbelief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were chiefly in the firſt place Gods choſen generation, is deſcribed by words of refuſall and rejection and gainſaying, acts quite contrary to thoſe of conſent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. —<hi>O Jeruſalem how often would I have gathered you? —and ye would not, i. e.</hi> not conſent or accept of it.

God made the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> in diverſe particulars, that he would give him the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for his Inheritance; that he would give him an heir from his own bowels; that he would make a great nation of him, and bleſs all nations in his Seed; that God would be a God to him and his Seed; would be their ſhield and their exceeding great reward. Hence <hi>Zachary</hi> the Father of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſings in his <hi>Benedictus,</hi> that God raiſed up <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Horn of Salvation for his promiſe ſake, to perform the mercy promiſed to our Fore-Fathers. Hence St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> grounds the People's delivery from <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon God's promiſe, when the time of the promiſe drew nigh that God had ſworn unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Antioch</hi> grounds the whole Goſpel upon God's promiſe,<note place="margin">

                           </p>
                           <p>Now, all Rights ariſing from promiſe, come to the Party to whom the promiſe is made, by no other means but by Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> by acceptance of the promiſe, by his conſent to accept of the Right ſpecified in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. For all promiſes are made effectual by Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> by his Faith, to whom the promiſe is made. For if he be unbelieving and refuſe it, then the promiſe is dead and of no effect; but if he give Faith to it and accept it, then it binds him that made it, and creates a right to him that accepts it. For acceptance forms a promiſe into a Covenant whereby there is a conveening or meeting of mind unto mind, and will unto will; <hi>i. e.</hi> of the mind and will of the Receiver, to the mind and will of the Promiſer.</p>
                           <pb n="389" facs="tcp:49664:218"/>
                           <p>Hence the Scripture ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he believed God, and it was counted unto him for Righteouſneſs; <hi>i. e.</hi> God made a promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Abraham</hi> conſented and accepted of the promiſe, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance created him a Right to all the things promiſed.</p>
                           <p>And again, <hi>The promiſe that Abraham ſhould be heir of the World,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.</note> 
                              <hi>came not to him through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith; i. e. Abraham</hi> had a right of inheritance to him and his Seed, yet that right came not to him by any act of the Law, but by the act of his Faith in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of God's promiſe. For as the promiſe was a meer act of Grace on God's part, ſo the acceptance was a meer act of Faith on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s part. And as it was between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo is the nature of all Promiſes.</p>
                           <p>Therefore I conclude, that the Title to Juſtification is by the Free-grace of God.</p>
                           <p>This Point requires no more handling, becauſe ſo manifeſt in it ſelf; and things that are manifeſt in themſelves, need no farther proofs.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſaak</hi> the younger by a Free-Woman, his Legitimate Son by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wife, <hi>Sarah,</hi> free born and free living, a Matron that had right of Bed and Board, Dower and Dignity, Power and Rule under her Husband over the Family.</p>
                           <p>As the two Mothers conditions were quite contrary the one to the other, ſo were the two Sons; for <hi>Partus ſequitur ventrem,</hi> one therefore a Bondman, the other a Freeman; one had no right to the Inheritance becauſe a Baſtard, the other had right becauſe a lawful Son.</p>
                           <p>So thoſe under the Law unjuſtified, are in the condition of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who though a Son, had neither the ſtate of a Perſon, nor the right of a Son, but was a Bondchild and Baſtard, becauſe he came from a Woman, who had not the ſtate of a Woman, nor the right of a Wife, but was a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid and a Concubine: So the Sons of the Law, that truſt to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bondwoman, ſhall be as little juſtified, or have as little right to the inheritance of Heaven as the Law can afford them, which is none at all;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49664:220"/> for Righteouſneſs comes not by the Law, and by the Law no fleſh can be juſtified; even as little right as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> could have to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who was born of a Woman, who had works enough, for ſhe was a Bondmaid, yet no right by them, for ſhe had no right in her Perſon.</p>
                           <p>But they that are under the Goſpel are juſtified, are in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſaak,</hi> who had the ſtate of a Perſon, and the right of a Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was born of a Free-Woman, who had the ſtate of a Woman, and the right of a Wife.</p>
                           <p>So the Sons of the Goſpel, that truſt to their Mother Free-Woman, ſhall be as much juſtified or have as much right to the Kingdom of Heaven as the Goſpel can afford, which is All right. Even as much right as <hi>Iſaak</hi> had to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s inheritance, who was born of the Free-Woman, who had Faith enough, for ſhe was free; and therefore All right by her Faith, for ſhe had all right in her Perſon.</p>
                           <p>This was the firſt difference between theſe two Sons on the Mother ſide, becauſe born of ſeveral venters.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond difference is on the Father's ſide: For though they had one and the ſame Father, yet they were begot from different principles, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in <hi>Abraham</hi> and enabling him to beget them.</p>

                           <p>Thus God was pleaſed to declare to the World, that his purpoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Election might ſtand firme and unchanged; and that he meant not to elect or make choice of thoſe whom he ſhould or would adopt by the rule of Works, or by any rule that Men ſhould commend to him, or deſire to impoſe, or obtrude upon him; but only by the Rule of his own moſt free gracious and wiſe pleaſure, which he hath declared to be the Rule of Faith.

                        <p>MY Juſtification by Faith through the Free-Grace of God, puts me into a ſtate of Righteouſneſs, and therefore it doth extinguiſh and deſtroy my ſtate of ſin: formerly I had no right to any thing, ſave a curſe
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:49664:223"/> for my ſin, but now I obtain a right to a Bleſſing through the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed to me. When a Slave is enfranchiſed, his ſlavery is thereby extinguiſhed; ſo when a Sinner is juſtified, his ſin is thereby actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſtroy'd. Becauſe theſe two ſtates are contrary one to another, and inconſiſtent one with another in one and the ſame Perſon, at one and the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>Yet upon my Juſtification, the paſſions, motions, or luſts of my ſin are not deſtroy'd <hi>in facto eſſe complete,</hi> but they are <hi>in fieri</hi> begun to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and in a good courſe and ready way to be extinct: For their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and over-ruling power is already deſtroy'd; ſo that they cannot compel me to the acts of ſin. And my Juſtification by <hi>Chriſt</hi> obliges me to this reſiſtance againſt ſin; and my Sanctification by the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth enable me to beat back the force of <hi>Satan</hi>'s temptations, more and more, and will enable me (if I faint not, or will fully turn back) to be more than a Conqueror.</p>
                        <p>But after my Juſtification, if I, through the ſubtilty of <hi>Satan,</hi> or the pravity of mine own heart, ſhall ſuffer my ſelf to be perſwaded, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is no bond upon me, or no power in me, or no Grace ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me to finiſh the work of mortification; and thereupon ſhall either neglect this work, or act quite contrary, not the acts of Ignorance or Infirmity, but of malice and preſumption, and of deſpair it ſelf: Then by theſe my ſinful acts, I do deſtroy the ſtate of my Juſtification, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade my ſelf, and make my ſelf unworthy of that Salvation which I was an heir unto, if by my reſipiſcence I do not recover it again.

                           <p>It is in it ſelf ſtable and permanent; it may and ſhould be perpetual, but during my Natural Life and before I die, it may be defeated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: I do not ſay, It muſt be defeated and deſtroyed, for the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it is not neceſſary, as is the mortality of the Body, which muſt die: But the mutability thereof is poſſible, for as it may, ſo it may not be defeated.</p>

                           <p>For when I was made a Member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a Child of God, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor

                           <p>For as Marriages, ſo rights of Inheritances are not temporary for term of years, but of perpetuity for ever. Hence the Son is ſaid to differ from the Servant, becauſe <hi>The Servant abideth not in the Houſe for ever;</hi>

If therefore my ſtate may be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, it may be deſtroyed.</p>
                           <p>I find by good hiſtory and ſad experience, that ſtates of perpetuity have been defeated and deſtroyed; that many a Man which had a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in Fee-ſimple to him and to his Heirs for ever; yet by making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a tranſgreſſor againſt his Lord and King, hath forfeited that his Eſtate to him and his Heirs for ever.</p>
                           <p>That many a Woman who was married for life, till death ſhould depart her and her Husband, yet by making her ſelf a tranſgreſſor againſt her Husband, hath been divorced from her Husband, and loſt her Husband and her Dower. That many a Son who was Heir apparent to his Father's Eſtate, yet by making himſelf a tranſgreſſor againſt his Father, hath been diſinherited, and loſt his Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>And the like is poſſible concerning my Eſtate of Juſtification; ſee the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Math.</hi> 12.43, 44. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                           <p>As alſo conſider the examples of <hi>Aaron, David, Solomon, &amp;c.</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and examples do neceſſarily demonſtrate the mutability of my Juſtification.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe to a thing that is impoſſible there needs no Exhortation, <label type="milestone">

                              </label> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. And,</p>
                           <p>Becauſe of a thing impoſſible, it is impoſſible that there ſhould be any Example.</p>
                           <p>The Grand Reaſon that my ſtate of Juſtification may be defeated, is becauſe it is Conditional; for though God's donation of my preſent right to be his Son and Heir, is abſolute without any condition or preceeding act on my part, except it be the paſſive act of my Faith to accept thereof; yet my future poſſeſſion of that inheritance, whereto I have now a preſent right, is conditional, and that condition runs upon my good behaviour, of deporting my ſelf as becomes the Son of God; for this condition is ſufficiently expreſſed in God's laſt Will and Teſtament. Or ſuppoſing, but not granting, that in God's Teſtament there is no mention made of any ſuch condition; yet ſuch a condition muſt be underſtood, becauſe the very Nature and Equity of the thing requires it: And the ſtate of a Son and Heir wherein I ſtand, doth neceſſarily draw this duty along with it, and ſo bind me thereto, that for non-performance thereof my ſtate may be deſtroyed.</p>
                           <p>Yet every treſpaſs will not deſtroy it neither, becauſe God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me a thouſand faults upon my repentance, and commands me to pray unto him therefore, and promiſes to forgive my treſpaſſes; and commands
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49664:225"/> me to forgive my Brother that repenteth, though he ſin againſt me ſeven times in a day; nay, ſeventy times ſeven times. Therefore certainly he being my Father, will upon my repentance forgive me more times for all the daies of my life.</p>
                           <p>For becauſe I am his Son, therefore I am not ſo much under his Law, as under his Grace; <hi>i. e.</hi> God will not deal rigorouſly and ſtrictly with me according to Law, to reject or puniſh me for every treſpaſs like a Slave, who is under the will and pleaſure of his Lord: but he will uſe me mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and kindly to correct me in meaſure, or to forgive me like a Son, who is under the love and grace of his Father.</p>
                           <p>But if I riſe up in open rebellion againſt my Heavenly Father, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his great Grace; and though I would be glad of his Inheritance, yet am unwilling to do him ſervice for it, but wilfully chooſe to ſerve my own luſts and follow the World, and am led captive by the Devil accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will, then I deſerve to be rejected, and ſhall be rejected unleſs I repent. For thoſe that honour God, God will honour; but thoſe that diſhonour him ſhall be lightly eſteem'd.</p>
                           <p>God's Grace is ſo far from being a licence for me to ſin, that it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from it to make me fear to offend. The more kind a Father is, the more ſhould the Son fear to offend him; becauſe the greater is his treſpaſs if he do offend him, who hath been ſo loving to him.</p>
                           <p>And as a kind Father is grieved to diſinherit his incorrigible Son; ſo when my tranſgreſſions become preſumptuous, malicious and incorrigible, my Heavenly Father is grieved to reprobate me, and caſt me off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees it not but in his wrath, when there is no help for it: As he did with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>

For the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as by <hi>Matthew</hi> only it is called) and the Kingdom of God, are all one and the ſame thing, though diverſly denominated; for both ſignifie that Bleſſedneſs, whereof God is the cauſe, and Heaven the place where it is enjoy'd: Yet in diverſe places of the Scripture, the Kingdom of God is put for the means whereby we are convey'd to that State.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Natural Man.</note>The Natural Man neither hath, nor ever had any right at all to this Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Bleſſedneſs; becauſe this right comes by God's promiſe, which he for want of Faith accepts not, and therefore is not in Covenant with God for it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Spiritual Man.</note>But the Spiritual Man hath a right unto it, for his Faith, whereby he accepts the promiſe of it, gives him a Title to it; and the Spirit, which by reaſon of his Faith is infuſed into his heart, makes him an aſſurance of it; for the Spirit is the Seal, the Witneſs and the Earneſt of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance: yea farther, the Spirit is his Guide and Comforter for light and ſtrength, to enlighten, lead and enable him to the performance of thoſe Offices and Services which make up the Tenure, whereby he holds that right, and perſeveres in it.</p>
                           <p>For as Faith doth infiliate and make him jurally the Son of God, by
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49664:225"/> way of Adoption, to have a right in the Eſtate of God: ſo the Spirit doth, in a degree farther, ſuper-infiliate him, by making him jurally the Son of God, by way of ſanctification, to be Holy as God is Holy. Becauſe as Faith, ſo alſo Holineſs is a mean unto the ſtate of Bleſſedneſs, whereto he ſhall certainly attain, who follows and perſeveres in that Holineſs whereto the Spirit leads and enables him. For by his Title of Faith, and by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from the Spirit, he hath a preſent right to the future poſſeſſion of it, as every Heir hath to his Father's Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>But if the Spiritual Man, whoſe regeneration is <hi>in fieri,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Forfeiture.</note> will not follow and walk after the Spirit, whom God hath given him for his leader, but upon the conflict between the Spirit and the Fleſh, will ſide with the Fleſh, to walk after the Fleſh, and do the works of the Fleſh, he cannot hold his right to Bleſſedneſs, but muſt needs forfeit it; becauſe he performs not the Services and Works, which are his tenure whereby he ſhould hold it, and at laſt enjoy it; but doth work ſo contrary to his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, that they extinguiſh and deſtroy his right of entrance, whereby he ſhould enjoy his future poſſeſſion.</p>
                           <p>For, what Father will not diſinherit that Heir who grows diſobedient and rebellious unto him, by committing acts contrary to the duty of a Son? Seeing that our Filiation or Chriſtian liberty, whereby we are the Sons of God, is not a ſtate of licentiouſneſs, which leaves us looſe from Holineſs unto ſinfulneſs; but contrarily makes us looſe from ſinfulneſs unto Holineſs, and conſequently unto Bleſſedneſs: And ſeeing the Grace of the Goſpel, which grants us that Bleſſedneſs, grants us not the leaſt indulgence to the Fleſh, or releaſeth the bonds of Holineſs and virtue, or promiſeth any pardon to him that ſins in hope of pardon; yet it is very indulgent and merciful to the ſins of infirmity, and human frailty, and leaveth God to the prerogative of his mercy for a ſin of preſumption, in caſe it be timely waſhed by a ſubſequent humiliation and repentance, in forſaking that ſin, and returning to the courſe of Holineſs.</p>
                           <p>And the inheritance of Bleſſedneſs in the Kingdom of God, is reſerved for thoſe Sons of God, who through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the Body, and are led by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13, 14. For ſuch are genuinely and properly the Sons of God, becauſe both jurally they have a right, and alſo morally are righteous to perſevere in that righteouſneſs whereby they hold their right, and whereby they are regenerated, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſanctified after the Image or likeneſs of their Heavenly Father, which Image he that practiſeth the works of the Fleſh, doth deface in himſelf, and thereby defeats himſelf of his Heavenly Inheritance. For although the righteous have a right; yet if he forſake that righteouſneſs whereby he ſhould hold the right he hath, and commit wickedneſs, all his right that he had, and all his righteouſneſs that he hath done, ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be mentioned nor remembred, but in his treſpaſs that he hath treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed he ſhall die. See <hi>Ezec.</hi> 18.24. and <hi>Ezec.</hi> 33.23.</p>
                           <p>God hath beſtow'd upon us the Sacred Gift of his Spirit to dwell in us, and to quicken our mortal Bodies, and we for this Gift are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not to the Fleſh to live after the Fleſh; <hi>For if we live after the Fleſh,</hi>

                           <p>The miſchief therefore that regularly follows upon our walking after the Fleſh, and committing of carnal ſins, is a Diſheriſon or excluſion of us from the actual entrance and poſſeſſion of that Heavenly inheritance, whereto by Faith we had a right and title: For although our good works are not ſufficient enough to create us a title to that Inheritance, yet our evil works are miſcreant enough to defeat us of the title we had by Faith, and to draw upon us a forfeiture of our former rights, becauſe our evil works argue us to be the Children of diſobedience, who will not be led and ruled by the Spirit of God, they convict us of ungraciouſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs for the Grace of God, and condemn us to endure the wrath of God.</p>
                           <p>For although the Goſpel be a Charter of Grace, yet this is the Law of it, againſt evil works, becauſe thereby we not only deſpair, but we do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, which is an affront unto God, who grants it; and ſo juſtly we loſe the benefit of the Grant through our own default.</p>

                        <p>MY ſtate of Election requires a Tenure.<note place="margin">Tranſition.</note> For becauſe the ſtate of it is thus mutable, therefore it requires a Tenure to preſerve and hold it. And becauſe my ſtate of Juſtification had a cauſe to create it, ſo alſo it requires a cauſe to conſerve it.</p>
                        <p>That which I have my Eſtate by is my Title, by Gift, or Birth, or work, or Purchaſe; and that which I hold my Eſtate by, is my Tenure or Homage by ſerviency, Eſcuage or Soccage, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Court-ſervice, War-ſervice, or Plough-ſervice.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe Eſtates are in this Life tranſitory and defeiſable, to come and go, to be had and loſt; therefore when I have an Eſtate, I muſt uſe the means to hold it, otherwiſe I may make no benefit by it.</p>
                        <p>And this is neceſſary in all Eſtates to have a Title to get, and a Tenure to keep, or elſe no Eſtate would be permanent; yea, the whole World, if it were not upheld by him that made it, would eternally fall to ruin.</p>
                        <p>The Tenure of my Juſtification is works. Therefore this aſſertion,<note place="margin">Works.</note> A Man is juſtified by works, and not by Faith, is as much the word of God as this aſſertion, A Man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and both are equally true.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Faith is the Title of Right to my Juſtification.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Works are the Tenure of this Right and Title till I am to poſſeſs the Inheritance which my Faith gave me Right and Title to.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſons by which St. <hi>James</hi> proves this Juſtification by works, are theſe:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe works keep Faith alive: The act of Faith without them is of no effect, though it did juſtifie to a right, becauſe without works follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we can have no benefit of our Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>As a Bill or Bond or other ſpecialty of Writing without a Seal or Hand, is voi'd cancell'd to all intents and purpoſes contained in them. So, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe Faith is by works made perfect; it being alone a thing imperfect, and ineffectual. For in juſtifying it gives a Right and Title of Inſtitution, and Expectation claims Intereſt and Hope of a future inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: which Right is eſcheatable, and may be deſtroied; but Faith ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded and animated by works,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</note> finiſhes and compleats our Right to a frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inheritance ſeized upon, inveſted in us, and ſubject to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiſance. —<hi>An inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by works, when he had offer'd up <hi>Iſaak</hi> his Son upon the Altar. And <hi>Rahab</hi> was juſtified by works, when ſhe

                        <p>Faith alone without works is like the Devil's faith, who tremble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope or works. And Faith without works is like the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Soul.</p>
                        <p>But though my Tenure of Juſtification be works, yet Faith is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Not works alone nor Faith alone, but both together do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Title of my Juſtification, which I had by Faith only.</p>
                        <p>And herein Faith hath the preeminence. Faith without works doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie me to have my Right and Title, but works without Faith do not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie me to hold my Right and Title: I ſay, not works with Faith, but thus, Faith with works doth make me hold my Right. Faith is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and works are the Acceſſaries thereunto to animate, enable and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Faith effectual to the poſſeſſion of an Inheritance, which that Faith gave right unto, but could not bring to a full enjoyment without works.</p>
                        <p>And farther, it is moſt certain that works do alſo juſtifie declaratively, by manifeſting that Faith to my ſelf and to the World, which did juſtifie me efficiently.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>James</hi> 2.18. explained.</note> —<hi>Shew me thy Faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith by my works.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">☞</note>Note here alſo, That <hi>Paul</hi> by his aſſertion that a Man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by Faith only, oppoſeth the <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> who were ſtill operaries and rituaries of the Law, thinking to be juſtified by them, to the <hi>Evangelical Chriſtians,</hi> who were fiducia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and ſpiritualiſts of the Goſpel, thinking to be juſtified by Faith only. And that <hi>James</hi> oppoſeth the <hi>Gentilizing Chriſtians,</hi> who were ſtill fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries and libertines, ſtanding only for Faith and Freedom, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting and diſgracing all works; to them that were truly <hi>Evangelical,</hi> that ſtood to their Faith and Liberty, but admitted and honoured all good works alſo: allowing therefore to the <hi>Verb</hi> juſtified theſe two ſenſes, of creating and conſerving Juſtification, it will follow, That Faith only without works doth create Juſtification, but Faith with works doth conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Juſtification. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> do full well agree, and <hi>James</hi>'s Doctrine will be a conſequence from <hi>Paul</hi>'s principles.</p>
                        <p>For becauſe my Faith only without works doth create my Juſtification; and becauſe evil works do deſtroy the ſtate of it, and do build again my ſtate of Sin, therefore it followeth, That good works do continue my ſtate of Juſtification, and keep it from ruin.</p>
                        <p>For in caſe I ſhould fall, my Faith alone cannot reſtore me; but if I recover working, my works of repentance muſt be the means of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.</note>And becauſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing:</hi> Therefore, as <hi>James</hi> teacheth <hi>Faith without works is dead.</hi> And laſtly becauſe as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but Faith that worketh by Love;</hi> Therefore, as <hi>James</hi> teaches, Faith working with works is by works made perfect.</p>
                        <p>For the farther clearing of this ſeeming contradiction of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> note, That as faith ſworn by the Vaſſal to his Lord juſtifies the Vaſſal to his Fee or benefice to have right thereto; ſo the Homage it ſelf is the life of his faith, and juſtifies him to the ſame benefice that he may hold his right ſo obtained by his Faith. In like manner faith made to God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies his Creature to the Eſtate of Bleſſedneſs to have right thereto; and the Homage it ſelf, which is the life of his faith, juſtifies him to the ſame
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:49664:227"/> Eſtate that he may hold his right ſo obtained by his faith. For faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out homage or works doth not juſtifie fully, nor homage or works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith. So true it is, that Faith though it doth juſtifie alone to have right, yet works alſo do juſtifie to hold it; ſo both Faith and Works do juſtifie compleatly, and not one without the other. And this diſtinction rightly weighed and compared, may eaſily put an end to this Controverſy.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe the works of Love are ſuper-legal, above and beyond the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to feed the hungry, and to cloth the naked, to entertain Strangers, viſit the Sick relieve the Priſoners, pray for Perſecutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. The works of Love are ſupernatural above and beyond the Law of Nature; as not to be angry, and not to reſiſt and revenge evil, to ſuffer perſecution gladly for Righteouſneſs ſake, to rejoyce in temptations, to lay down our life for the Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore much more for God: To love our Enemies, and comparatively to hate our Friends,<note place="margin">

Her love was therefore ſuperlegal, above and beyond the Law; for no Law commanded to entertain Spies, to the deſtruction of a City. And her love was ſupernatural, above and beyond the Law of Nature, when ſhe ſhew'd kindneſs to her Enemies, in houſing, hiding and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them away ſafely.</p>
                           <p>The Ceremonious works of the Ritual Law are carnal in themſelves, and could juſtifie to nothing but a carnal purity and a ſecurity from a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment of Death.</p>
                           <p>All theſe Rites of Sacrificing, Waſhing, Feaſting, Faſting, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are extinct.</p>
                           <p>The Moralities of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as to be no idolater, no forſwearer, no murderer, adulterer, thief, lyar nor deceiver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the bare negative duties for the moſt part, and according to the letter, are themſelves dead, and I am dead to that dead Letter, which killed thoſe that are under it with a curſe, and it is a part of my Juſtification to be free from the Law; for I am not under the Law, but under Grace; nor under the Letter, but under the Spirit.</p>
                           <p>And therefore the works of the Goſpel are works of the Spirit, which gives life by faith, and maintaineth it by Love; the works whereof are purely Spiritual, inward and lively, free from all carnal and outward ſhew and formality.

                           <p>Faith performed or kept, is the diſcharge of the credit or truſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the giver to the receiver, and of the giver himſelf: each is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to promiſe, give, receive and keep.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. God's promiſe is his ſponſion or faith given, a ſingle act of his will to deviſe to us a preſent right to a future inheritance.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. This conſent of wills of giving and receiving makes a perfect Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby God and Man are ſure to each other, and mutually obliged, as in all Contracts, to each other.</p>
                           <p>For faith is that that binds both God and Man; Law binds not God, but Man only: Becauſe God is above his Law, and may change it; but God is not above his faith and promiſes, he cannot change them.</p>
                           <p>Search then and ſee if there be any evidence or conveyance, that can create a better right or ſettlement for any Eſtate in Heaven or Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God or Man, than Faith can do.</p>

                              <pb n="411" facs="tcp:49664:229"/>1. God binds himſelf by promiſe and oath, as he is the Creator and Lord promiſing of and for himſelf, and ſwearing by and for himſelf; and more than all this, takes his death (by ſubſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) upon it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Man binds himſelf by promiſe and oath to God, as he is his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Vaſſal, then he binds himſelf over again in his Baptiſm, as he is his Creature and Heir, and takes his death upon it by drowning himſelf under the water; a ſign of dying unto ſin, being buried with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and riſing again out of the water, a ſign of riſing with <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto newneſs of Life.</p>
                           <p>So that if thy Faith oblige thee to the duty of a Son, it will oblige God to the Bleſſings of a Father, and he will not only by Nature and Grace adopt thee to be his Son, but by Covenant and Pact inſtitute thee to be his Heir: and if thy faith oblige thee not to the duty of a Son, it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige God from the Bleſſings of a Father, and he may diſinherit thee, having broken the Covenant for thy treachery and rebellion.</p>
                           <p>The Faithful have a promiſe: —<hi>I will be to thee a Father,</hi>

                           <p>This great Inſtrument of Man's Salvation called Faith, is an eaſie,<note place="margin">Of Phyſical Operation.</note> gentle and noble thing in it ſelf, but hath been repreſented difficult and obſcure, and great quarrels have been made about it, and little hopes of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning it, unleſs ſecond and third thoughts be framed by unbiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:49664:233"/> and conſidering Men, ſo to undeceive themſelves and others. For hitherto the World hath been impoſed upon, and amuſed to conceive, that Faith and other Graces of God are habits infuſed by God into Mens Souls, quickning their dead Faculties, which neither know nor feel any thing that is done unto them, till they ſee themſelves in a new condition and frame of Spirit, which they call the Work of Grace irreſiſtible, as is the faſhioning of a lump of clay into a new mold, or the raiſing of a Man, that is dead and rotten, or the turning of a wheel by meer ſtrength, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in motion by the ſpring and weights that are put upon it.</p>
                           <p>Hereupon the poor People lye ſtill, and endeavour nothing; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if they be elected after the Covenant of Grace to the end, they are elected in time to the means, whether they will or no; and that they have no will at all to any Good, not ſo much as to accept it when offered, but rather an averſion from it, and a proneneſs to all evil to draw it to them, and hatefully to turn all goodneſs from them.</p>
                           <p>This Phyſical operation which they dream to be upon their Spirits, is the ſame with earthly bodies, which are moved by natural or artificial cauſes of force or virtue, the greater ſtrength violently prevailing over the leſs, as we move logs and ſtones by the power of horſes or Men, or curiouſly turning of vaſt bodies by Engines and Wheels of Art.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Operation Moral.</note>Whereas in deed and in truth the operations upon the Soul are moral, rather than phyſical, with no other violence or force, than that which is not properly ſo, but intellectual and rational, or perſuaſive and inviting, unleſs you will call that a phyſical way of the working of Spirits upon Spirits; but ſtill it is free and fair, without force or battery, but ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal by information of the judgment and perſuaſion of the Will. For <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid operatur, operatur ad modum operantis, &amp; quicquid patitur, patitur ad modum patientis:</hi> Whatſoever acts, acts according to the quality of the Agent; and whatſoever ſuffer, ſuffers according to the condition of the patient.</p>
                           <p>Here is therefore nothing of a real touch of the Agent upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, to create neceſſarily a real change and alteration of the Patient thereby from what it was before, but a virtual motion of inſtruction and inſinuation upon an underſtanding and free ſubject to convince and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the ſame faculties, and call them off to new objects freely from their former miſtakes.</p>
                           <p>So the vulgar are made to believe of Gods turning, hardning, ſoftning, opening or ſhutting of Mens hearts, as Men do of the motion of natural bodies by ſtrength or wit, not conſidering that theſe things are ſpoken <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, after the manner of Men, Metaphorically for our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
                           <p>And if wiſe Men are able by ſolid reaſons to convince Mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Eloquent Men are able to incline their wills and affections, how much more is the Alwiſe God by his Spirit able to clear our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to a full ſatisfaction, and to draw our deſires to thoſe divine truths, which he hath revealed by Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                           <p>What more there is in the work of God's converſion of Men, by his calling, Juſtification and Sanctification of them, let any Man ſatisfie me fairly,<note place="margin">Saving Faith.</note>

                           <p>If Saving Faith, properly ſo called, be an entring into Covenant with God, in aſſenting to the promiſes of his Laſt will and Teſtament, and making reciprocal promiſes to him again for Juſtification: And if Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:49664:233"/> be a keeping of our Covenant, or faithfulneſs to our promiſes for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.

                           <p>All things are free in rational Agents and Patients: A rational free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent thus works upon a rational free Patient:

                           <p>This is Divine and Humane working and drawing with the cords of Love. So Wiſdom enters into the Soule: Not as water out of one veſſel into another, while one veſſel knows not what another doth, but by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Wiſdom, precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little, and there a little.</p>
                           <p>This is our forcing and faſhioning anew, our partaking of the Divine Nature, and of the precious promiſes of God, our regeneration, our new Creation, our Tranſlation from the power of Darkneſs into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God. This is to be in the ſtate of Grace, to be Elect, to have our Names written in the Book of Life, to be in Covenant and Alliance with God, to be his Children, Heirs, and Co-heirs with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If Faith comes ordinarily by hearing, or otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Means of Faith.</note> where there is no preaching, even by Converſation, Contemplation, obſervation of Divine Providences, or by other unknown inſtincts and revelations. All theſe waies and means are informative and perſuaſive; and the more becauſe they come from a Divine Spirit and offer a Divine reward, and carry a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance along with them.</p>
                           <p>This is a more God like and Man like way, from a free Creator to a free Creature, than an inſenſible, irreſiſtible, plaſtick power upon a dead ſtock or ſtone.</p>
                           <p>It would be mockery to a Soul in that ſenſeleſs and ſlaviſh condition to bid it hear that is deaf, or ſee that is blind, or run that is lame.</p>
                           <p>Then to what purpoſe is Reaſon, Will or Memory, or are they loſt by our fall, and where are they, if we can anſwer without bluſhing?</p>
                           <p>God can do all this and more. <label type="milestone">

                           <p>It is not noble to give any thing to one that refuſeth, or to continue it to him, that after acceptation and reception, will not uſe it or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
                           <p>As for the notion of a New Heart and a New Spirit:<note place="margin">A New Heart.</note> It is as when a Man is advanced to any Dignity or Rule. He is a New Man, and hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Spirit; yet the ſame individual Soul and Body remains.</p>
                           <p>How much more when a Man by being in League and Covenant with his God, is advanced to the Dignity of a Son and Heir of Heaven, hath a Man a New Heart and Spirit? yet the ſame individual Soul and Body
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:49664:234"/> remains, ſo doth he live above himſelf and all the World, to what he did before; yet he is the ſame Perſon, though altered in his conditions.</p>
                           <p>And God gives this Spirit to this Faith, which is the Gift of God.</p>

                           <p>You will rue for all this if you take not heed. Young Man take thy full ſwing, let looſe the reins to a full carier, but remember that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment; a day of reckoning will come, Do not put the day of death far from the, do not make a League with Hell, nor a Covenant with deſtruction, ſaying; The bitterneſs of death is paſt, and the over-flowing ſcourge ſhall paſs over me; for it will come, it will not tarry.</p>
                           <p>Thus there is a voice behind you, yea, within you, ſaying; This is the way walk in it: Turn from the waies of wickedneſs, paſs by them, and come not near unto them, for fear iniquity procure your ruine. A Harlot's mouth is ſweet as the hony, and drops as the hony-comb, but her waies go down unto Hell, and her paths take hold of deſtruction; ſhe is a deep pit, and he that feareth not the Lord ſhall fall into it. As a bird haſtens to the ſnare, and a fool to the correction of the ſtocks, and an Ox to the ſlaughter, not remembring that it is for his Life; ſo ſhall it be with thee.</p>
                           <p>Theſe and the like warnings of the Conſcience are rare preventions of ſins, if hearkned unto, or elſe they procure greater torments afterwards. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Why have ye lyed to the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> unto <hi>Dives; Remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and contrarily Lazarus evil things; but now thou art tormented and he is comforted. —We fools counted his life madneſs, but now is he numbred among the Righteous. —They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and be in bitterneſs as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt born. They ſhall call to the Mountains to fall upon them, and to the Hills to cover them from the wrath of him that ſitteth upon the Throne.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is the regret that ſhall be, that weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth, that worm of conſcience that never dieth.</p>
                           <p>O! that Men were wiſe therefore, that they would conſider theſe things, that they might not do amiſs.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Noli tanti emere poenitere;</hi> Buy not thy repentance at ſo dear a rate. What profit will it be for a Man to gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul. Chooſe Life, that your Souls may live. Chooſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon. <hi>Ex hoc momento dependet Aeternitas;</hi> Upon this moment of time hangs the huge weight of all Eternity.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe of ſome remnants of ſin unmortified, and not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe of ſome violent diſeaſe of the Body, obſtructing the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the Soul, and hindring the ſenſe of comforts to the outward Man.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Becauſe of the high quality of Grace, not graſped by the weak Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but by degrees much leſs perceived by the adjacent ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Becauſe of the Natural Temper and Complexion of Melancholy, whoſe vapours create fears and ſorrows in the ſenſitive part of the Soul. While in the inward and rational part, there wants not hope or comfort by its union and communion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the ſecret and inexpreſſible embraces of each other, and the ſweet influences of a Divine Spirit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſufficient ſupportations all the while.</p>
                        <p>Comforts muſt be thruſt into ſuch mens boſoms, as if they belonged not to them, and were unwilling to receive them, while they long for them, and take them <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, with a willing unwillingneſs.</p>
                        <p>They eye the terrours of God's judgments too much with their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and caſt too few glances upon his Saving mercies: They conceive too narrowly of the Grace of God, and ſtreighten his Favours, which they ſhould enlarge. They look downwards too long upon their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and not upwards to the worthineſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſay, they have no hope, yet they would not let go their hold, nor looſe their hopes and intereſts in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or deny him for ten thouſand Worlds.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Therefore it is poſſible for a good Conſcience to conclude ſadly and falſly againſt it ſelf, although it hath good Principles to conclude
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:49664:241"/> comfortably and truly by: But during the temptation, and as it were the eclipſe of the ſenſe of God's Favour, the perturbation of the lower part of the Soul hinders the diſcovery of the Grace of God, which is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part thereof.</p>
                        <p>Nor can I underſtand how the Conſcience which is juſtified, and at peace with God and ſanctified, to whom nothing can lay any charge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, ſhould really and truly charge or condemn it ſelf, or be perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed for thoſe ſins that are fully and freely pardoned, or for thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are as fully and freely removed by the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But in this weak Fleſh there will be fears and doubts and cauſeleſs complaints, which will ceaſe by degrees till all be removed when death comes.</p>
                        <p>They talk of a Conſcience quiet but not good, and good but not quiet, and good and quiet, and neither good nor quiet; but ſuch Rimes and Cadences, and flaſhes will give no ſolid ſatisfaction to a piercing Spirit. Men may run them over with their tongues in haſt, and they make a jingling noiſe; but in the brain they will keep no time at all.</p>

                              </label> the domineering brazen-faced will without all fear or ſhame. As for the Natural Conſcience in the moſt wicked Men, it is utterly againſt ſuch doings: with their Mind they would ſerve the Law of God, but with their Fleſh, the Law of ſin: They delight in the Law of God after the inward Man, but there is another law in their members warring againſt the Law of their Mind, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into captivity to the Law of ſin.</p>
                           <p>But why ſo little remorſe appears in them that do theſe horrid things? Truly, I cannot tell what to ſay in this caſe. If there be no inward pangs, I ſhould wonder; it muſt be a very hard heart that never relents, and that's a moſt deſperate condition both of Sin and miſery.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In good Men. How do their conſciences come to be ſo much troubled?</p>
                           <p>I anſwer, Why indeed? For I know no juſt cauſe. There is a juſt cauſe of fear for the Body, that may fall upon a conſtant and ſtout Man, when ſudden and imminent danger threatens death. But for a juſt cauſe of fear for the Soul, to fall upon a faithful, juſtified and ſanctified Man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt, and adopted the Son and Heir of God, I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Fearful they are and may be, but it is their fancy, their paſſion and humour that makes them ſo, not their real Conſcience.</p>
                           <p>There are that put too many cauſes of Conſcience, and make doubts which they can never reſolve, and tye knots which they can never unlooſe, and raiſe devils which they are never able to lay again. Confeſſors make a Trade of it, and a good one too: unlock the cloſets of Mens Hearts, but more of their Purſes. Poor Souls are oppreſſed by Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; as Mens Eſtates are by Caſes of Law, and as Mens Bodies are by Phyſick.</p>
                           <p>There are certain plain Rules, that would reſolve all doubts to a plain meaning Man, better than all their ſubtil Diſtinctions. A few neceſſary Doctrines of Faith, and a good life will do the work, and the Brethren ought to be troubled no farther.</p>
                           <p>As for thoſe that pretend every thing to be againſt their Conſciences, it is a manifeſt cheat. For it is their luſt, and that hath the caſting voice
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:49664:242"/> with them in all that they do, and whatſoever is contrary to their luſts, is falſly affirm'd to be againſt their Conſciences; becauſe they will ſuffer no rule of Law to come upon them, but would do even what they liſt.</p>
                           <p>Many Controverſies trouble many, as of Original Sin, Free-Will, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Real preſence, Merits, Predeſtination, Infallibility, Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Faith, Repentance, Love, Honeſty, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are eaſie practical things, and perplex no body; for who can except againſt a Holy Life?</p>
                           <p>None but profane Libertines and Atheiſts, whom all abhorre, will find fault with Godlineſs and Honeſty. It were good if Learned Men would leave their idle and curious Speculations, and buſie themſelves in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sciences, which make for the Glory of God, and benefit of Mankind. <hi>Magna eſt dementia in tantâ temporis brevitate ſupervacanea diſcere:</hi> It is madneſs to ſpend a ſhort life, in learning unneceſſary things. <hi>Diſcito eam Scientiam cujus cognitio perſeverabit in Coelis:</hi> Learn that Knowledg which in Heaven we ſhall perfectly underſtand.</p>

                              <hi>Socrates</hi> was famous above all the Philoſophers of the World, for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Philoſophy, from Speculation to practiſe. There are but two things which are neceſſary in reſpect of God, our ſelves and the World, a good Conſcience and a good Name.</p>

                        <p>Firſt therefore as to good Men; They adviſed and required</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Believe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note>To believe their own Conſciences notwithſtanding ſtrong temptations to the contrary, and notwithſtanding bodily diſcompoſures.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe temptations are lyes not Truths; the inſtigations and allurements are in themſelves evil, and they tend and move to evil; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not in themſelves, nor in their motions to be truſted, I ſay to believe their Conſciences.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are juſtified by Faith, and ſanctified by the Spirit of Truth, and therefore have peace with God, and are at peace with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do not, cannot flatter falſly to a lye; becauſe they are of the Truth, and the Truth is in them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe diſeaſes and pains in the Body, which occaſion doubts and fears in the mind, are only in the outward Man, and the inward Man is not toucht at all: But the Soul enjoyes intimate union and communion with God, as much when the Body is afflicted, more and than at any other time, and exerciſes more Faith, and Love, and Patience, and Hope, and hath more trials and experiences of Grace, and is more firmly faſtned upon the Rock and foundation of Jeſus Chriſt, than at any other time.</p>
                        <p>The Conſcience therefore, when obſerved upon enquiry and ſearch
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:49664:244"/> thereinto, ſpeaks comfortable Truth, which God would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and we ought to believe it. But the paſſions occaſioned by ſickneſs and miſery ſpeak nothing but uncomfortable lyes, which the Devil would have us to believe, but we ought not to believe him nor them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Becauſe the natural temper and conſtitution of many Bodies tend to fears and ſorrows in the mind by the vicinity of humours that have a kind of operation upon them. Notwithſtanding all which paſſions, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is taught to remember, that ſhe hath no reaſon to doubt of her good condition, becauſe theſe griefs and terrors are no ſins of hers, but rather her miſeries and afflictions indeed, of which ſhe hath juſt cauſe to complain and ask for a removal, but not for pardon, which is only proper for ſin, not miſery.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Becauſe Faith in the Heart is above Senſe in the Fleſh: And we live by Faith and not by Senſe, and therefore we are to believe Faith and not Senſe; yea, to believe a bove Hope and contrary to Hope, which is above Senſe, and contrary to ſenſe; I know not how, nor I know not why in the judgment of my Fleſh, but this I know, that he is Faithful which hath promiſed to give, and I have promiſed to obey, and I will truſt in him, and be obedient unto him, though I be ſometimes at a ſtand, yet I will not let go my hold, but ſtrengthen my ſelf and comfort my ſelf in my God, in proſperity and adverſity. He is my God; though I feel not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; yet I have them, and ſhall have them, and if I want them, I ſhall ſtrive to be content, and though I gain nothing deſirable from him here, yet I ſhall take God alone to be ſufficient for me, and to be my exceeding great Reward.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Becauſe God's Principles breed none but good concluſions. <hi>Ex ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris nil niſi vera ſequuntur:</hi> Though in my error of paſſion I am not able to make it out, yet God ſhall make it out for me. Many an honeſt Debtor is not able to make out his own dues, but a juſt and merciful Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; will help him, and make it out for him, that he ſhall not be a loſer: What therefore is wanting in me I believe God will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and I am ſure to be ſafe in his hands; ſay mine own pretended Conſcience, and the Devil, or Men of deviliſh Spirits what they will: they may vex and perplex me, and break my heart with grief, but they ſhall never be able to deſtroy my Soul and Body in Hell fire. For I am fully perſwaded, that neither height nor depth, nor length nor breadth, nor Life nor death, nor any thing elſe ſhall be ever able to ſeparate me from the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; and that being juſtified by Faith, I have peace with God, and that if God hath juſtified, none ſhall condemn me; no, not my own Conſcience, which is ſanctified as is my whole Soul and Body by the Spirit of God which is in me.</p>
                        <p>Thus an honeſt Heart and humble Soule is in a ſafe condition with God in the midſt of fears and terrours occaſioned by temptations, ariſing from ſickneſs, pains and diſtempers of a weak Body. So am I like a Ship that lives in a ſtorm, while the winds drive her, and the waves run over her. So to the pure all things are pure: the Conſcience being good, all things that come from it are good, and all that comes unto it, ſhall be for good.</p>
                        <p>Secondly as to wicked Men; their remedy is this,<note place="margin">Not believe Conſcience.</note> they are adviſed and required,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Not to believe their own Conſciences, notwithſtanding ſtrong illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the contrary, and notwithſtanding their bodily good compoſures, and outward peace and proſperity to all things.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="442" facs="tcp:49664:245"/>1. Becauſe flatteries of peace, are lyes and not truths; there is no peace to the wicked: and what peace can there be ſo long as their whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and witchcrafts are ſo many?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are not juſtified by Faith, therefore they are not at peace with God, nor with their own Souls; becauſe they are not of the Truth, neither is Truth in them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe health and eaſe in the Body, and outward flouriſhing and tranquillity may be in the Eſtate, though the Soul have no union or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God at all: Nor is it any ſign of God's favour or disfavour to thrive and proſper, or to ſuffer in this World, but all things happen alike to all Men in this World, and no Man knoweth what is good or bad by any thing that is before him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Becauſe their natural tempers and conſtitution of bodies may tend to mirth, joy and rejoycing in the lower faculties, while the higher powers of the Mind and Conſcience are defiled, and have no hope nor comfort in them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Becauſe Senſe in the Fleſh is below Faith in the Heart, and they live by Senſe and not by Faith, and therefore they believe Senſe and not Faith, becauſe there is no Faith in them to believe. And ſo they live by Senſe, which is no life but death. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They have no reaſon therefore at all to believe their own Conſciences, falſly ſo called; for the Conſcience ſpeaks bitter things unto them, and that they may believe; and if the Offices of Conſciences be ſuſpended in them; it is becauſe the habits and cuſtoms of ſin have taken away the ſenſe thereof, and created a hardneſs, darkneſs, ſtupefaction and numneſs in them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They are to hearken to good counſel without, for there is none within, or very rare; but when it is, they are not to neglect it at any hand.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They are carefully to obſerve calamities ordinary and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary that happen to themſelves or others, which are ſent of God on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to awaken them from their ſins.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They are to ceaſe from the hurry and noiſe of pleaſures and profits of this World, and to make a ſtand ſometimes, and to retire into their own thoughts, and look up to God, and remember their later end, and put a ſtop to their nots and exceſſes, and try to ſhake them off by degrees, and ſtrive to enter into a courſe of honeſty, ſobriety and temperance; and ſee how it may work in them by little and little, till they come to their wits again, and live like Men, by Reaſon; and ſo farther, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by Faith, and not meerly as Beaſts, by Senſe. And this they may do if they will, and recover, and come to, by breaking off their ſins by repentance and their iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor.</p>
                        <p>To this end all Men are exhorted,</p>
                        <p n="1">

                        <p>There is a lye in my right hand, I hide iniquity under my tongue. I mock God and my Soul. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe Man is commanded and ſeriouſly exhorted by God to action of newneſs and renewing and turning to God, and to cleanſe and purge himſelf, to put off the Old Man, to be transformed, to walk and ſerve God in newneſs of Life, to caſt away the works of darkneſs, and to put on the Armour of Life; to have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather to avoid them; to be planted in the likeneſs of Chriſt's death and reſurrection; to try all things, and to hold faſt that which is good; to prove what is that good and acceptable Will of God; to purge out the old Leaven, to cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit; to hate the garments ſpotted by the Fleſh, and to keep themſelves unſpotted from the World.</p>
                           <p>Creation therefore here doth not ſignifie the real and ſole act of God in creating anew, but the action of Man alſo flowing from that ſtate of Man's new Creation, in reſpect whereof he is ſaid to be a New Man, and a New Creature; which action of God and Man is ſaid to avail in Chriſt

                           <p>It will not therefore be ſafe to ſay, That God is the ſole Agent in the New Creation, as he was in the Old, without all concurrence of Man's action: Nay, with all reluctance that Man can poſſibly make, while God is in the act of Man's Renovation. For,</p>
                           <p>It is one thing to frame that Man who hath neither life nor being, and another thing to reform that Man who is already exiſtent and living, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Underſtanding and Will, and ſo to change him not for his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but for his Judgment, affections and manners; <hi>i. e.</hi> to raiſe in him the knowledg and deſire, and act to follow ſome certain Religion, or courſe of life, and ſo to work in him the will and the deed, after the manner of a Rational ſubject.

                              </gap>, the Mind of the Fleſh, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, the Will of the Fleſh; the other is the Mind of the Spirit, and the Will of the Spirit: Or, which is all one, there is in every Man Senſe and Reaſon, and the Senſitive and Rational appetite, a part Terreſtrial and a part Celeſtial, a Brute and an Angel.</p>
                           <p>According to theſe Principles and eſſential parts conſtituting the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Men, ſo they do, and muſt live, both the Life of ſenſe and of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But if the ſenſitive powers are predominate, then the Rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties lye ſtill, and the life is juſt like the life of a Beaſt and no more, purely ſenſual: But if the Rational faculties prevail, then the ſenſitive powers are kept in compaſs, and the life is the true life of a Man, and no more, purely Rational.</p>
                           <p>But if the Spirit of Faith come upon the Soul, it advanceth the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and directs the Will to the greater mortification of the Fleſh, and ſuppreſſion of the unjuſt deſires thereof; and the life is the true exact life of a Chriſtian purely Spiritual.</p>
                           <p>So there is a threefold life in Man, of ſenſe, of Reaſon, and of Faith;<note place="margin">Life in Man threefold.</note> Natural, Animal, Spiritual.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Life of Senſe is unregenerate; for that which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, and no more, as it came from its principles. So the Fleſh acteth and ſatisfies it ſelf in Hearing, Seeing, Taſting, Feeling, and Smelling, as do the Brutes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Life of Reaſon is the <hi>Embryo,</hi> tending to Regeneration, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chriſtian; for that which is the off ſpring of Reaſon is Reaſon, and no more, as it came from its principles. So the Soul acteth and ſatisfies it ſelf in underſtanding, willing, and chooſing, and reflecting, as do An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men with themſelves, and with one another.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Life of the Spirit by Faith is the conſummation of Regeneration, and a new Creation, and altogether Chriſtian; for that which is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the Spirit is Spirit, and all true Senſe and Reaſon, as it flow'd from its principles. So the Soul acteth and ſatisfies it ſelf in more ſublime Judgment, Love and Choice, and rare Recognitions, and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as do Saints and Bleſſed Spirits with God, and their own Souls.</p>
                           <p>So there is the Life of Natural Senſe, the Life of Natural Reaſon, the Life of Supernatural Faith and Reaſon.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Life of Nature is good <hi>quà</hi> Nature or Senſe, till it exceed the bounds of Natural Reaſon and poſitive Law; for ſin is only a tranſgreſſion of Law.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Life of Reaſon is better, till it oppoſes unreaſonably the Reaſon of Grace and Faith.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Life of Grace is beſt of all, which regulates the Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and perfects both.</p>

                           <p n="7">7. The Mind and Will of the Spirit perfecting and ſanctifying the Mind and Will of Senſe, and the Mind and Will of Reaſon, were the Gift of God by Promiſe or Covenant and Faith of God and Man, convey'd to Mankind by the means of Regeneration, without ſin and after ſin, and Law that made ſin to be known, by Grace and Pardon through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. Thus the Life of Senſe is natural and good, till it exceed in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the rules and limits of a law put upon it. For ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a law; and where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion, but ſtill the ſenſe is unregenerate.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Life of Reaſon is natural and better in a tendency to Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while it acts like it ſelf by rules of right Reaſon, and the Law of Nature, till it be debauched by the carnal Mind and Will, and drawn down to unreaſonable notions and appetites.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Life of Faith is Supernatural, good and beſt of all, which is the ſtate of Regeneration, and a new Creation of a new and perfect Man in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. Conſider a Man that leads a Spiritual Life.</p>
                           <p>He is very buſie about what pleaſes his Soul, he takes care for his Soul's health, he ſearches for the true gain, he ſtudies for the true Wiſdom.</p>

                           <p n="5">5. Thus by Faith I am juſtified to the promiſe.</p>
                           <p>By Faith, I enter into the Promiſe; by Faith I receive the Spirit of Promiſe, the Adoption, Sanctification, Hope, Comfort, Love and Glory; by Faith I labour in the works of Love, and work out my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling; by Faith I hold out in proſperity, from being tranſlated, raviſhed or overcome by peace, wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By Faith I hold out in adverſity, and live in all ſtorms, from being overwhelmed by pain, grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into deſpair.

                           <p>The Reaſons of Hope are:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe every Inheritance is an expectance: The Inſtitution of an Heir, preceding the Induction.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe God hath commanded us to wait. Now, if God had never intented this inheritance for us, and promiſed it unto us by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he would never have bidden us to wait for it, nor have given us his Spirit as an earneſt thereof before hand.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Becauſe we have accepted it. Now, if it were never given nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, we would not be ſuch fools as to look for that, which either was never offered, or refuſed by us, when it was offered.</p>
                           <p>But now every Faithful Soul may juſtly look for that which is their due, from God or good Men, and they ſhall be ſure to have it, if they faint not. For God and good Men will be ſure never to fail of their promiſes. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may fail, and ſhall fail; but not the leaſt title of the word of God ſhall ever fail. God is faithful in promiſes and keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for ever. His word is a more ſure word than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which are ſaid not to alter; though both their Laws and Kingdoms are long ſince altered and gone. But God liveth ever to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he hath promiſed and ſworn, who is Truth it ſelf, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie.</p>
                           <p>Nothing therefore can hinder Aſſurance on God's part, but breach of Faith on our part.</p>
                           <p>None therefore can fail of their hopes but hypocrites, becauſe they are unfaithful, in not keeping the Covenant made with God; therefore their hopes ſhall periſh, and their expectation ſhall be cut off as the ſpiders web before him. They are fallen from Grace, and have diſinherited and deſtroy'd themſelves; but in God was and might have been their help.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. To wait in death, for ſtrength of Spirit to bear the agonies and terrors of that diſmal encounter, and for victory to overcome that <hi>Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ſupplicium,</hi> that laſt and worſt of woes.</p>

                        <div n="1" type="section">

                              <note place="margin">Matter of Fact.</note>1. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in this World actually in the Fleſh, and converſed openly with Men, taught them, wrought Miracles, died among them, and roſe again, and was ſeen of them after his Reſurrection.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a Perſon ſent from God, to preach and publiſh his laſt Will and Teſtament to all Mankind; and he began with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſent his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> That this <hi>Chriſt</hi> was exactly fore-told by all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and was teſtified to be the Son of God, by the voice of God from Heaven, ſaying; <hi>I am well pleaſed, hear ye him:</hi> And that he juſtified himſelf to be the Son of God, and the Author and Finiſher of our Salvation, who was crucified through weakneſs, but lived by the power of God. And after he had died for our ſins, roſe again for our juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Law-giver propounded the pureſt Rules of Holineſs, and the higheſt Rewards of happineſs, introduced the moſt Spiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that ever was manifeſted unto Mankind; that he put an everlaſting period to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rites, and confounded the Wiſdom of the World by the fooliſhneſs and weakneſs of God, which is wiſer and ſtronger than the Wiſdom and ſtrength of the World: That he brake the Devil's power and malice, ſilenced the lying Oracles, and lay'd flat the ſtrong holds of Sin and Satan to the ground: And ſet up his Kingdom againſt all Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers and Spiritual wickedneſſes in high places, and the gates of Hell ſhall never be able to to prevail againſt it.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="461" facs="tcp:49664:254"/>4. That Chriſt's Apoſtles ſaw and heard all that he did, ſpake and ſuffered; and the Glory of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and teſtified to the World all theſe things which they had ſeen and heard, without all hope of Reward in this Life, againſt all diſcouragements of perſecutions and deaths. And that the Spirit of God was ſo powerful in theſe illiterate and obſcure Men, as to indue them with Wiſedom and Underſtanding from on High, and with courage and reſolution, to preach the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the enduring of the Croſs, by mortification and ſelf-denyal, and renunciation of the World, in order thereunto: Things hard to be believed, done or ſuffered by Fleſh and Blood; but mightily aſſured of, performed and endured by themſelves and their Diſciples, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting the Learning of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> out-pleading the Orators, and over-coming the powerful oppoſitions of both, and of all others tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Goſpel from the power of Darkneſs of Satan into the glorious Kingdom of the dear Son of God.</p>
                           <p>Thus the Ground of our Aſſurance ſufficeth as to credence for matter of Fact.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Our accepting and free embracing them, as to our ſelves, drawing the right of thoſe Promiſes unto us.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Our obedience or obſervation of them accordingly, preſerving thoſe Rights unto us.</p>
                           <p>All which is our Faith, whereby we are juſtified to all the Rights procured, purchaſed and publiſhed by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: Thus living, and dying, and riſing again, and ſending of his Spirit, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Heaven, and offering himſelf to God as a Prieſt and Sacrifice, and ſitting at the Right Hand of his Father, to rule over all, for us Men, and for our Salvation: That where he is thither he might bring us, who is thus gone before us to prepare a place for us.</p>
                           <p>This is great Aſſurance, and there can be no evidence, nor conveyance or ſettlement greater or more ſecure than this. The Word of God ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſure, and our reliance thereupon: We know we are the Sons of God. What ſaith Chriſt? —<hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you; he that heareth my word,</hi>

                           <p>When Chriſt departed from his Diſciples by leaving the World, he bid them not be troubled at his corporal abſence, for he would ſend his Holy Spirit the Comforter, to abide with them; and ſo would be ſpiritually preſent with them all, all that ſhould ſucceed them in the Faith, unto the end of the World. Therefore accordingly, when they were troubled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly after his death, and doubted that he was not the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was dead and buried: And after his Reſurrection, they were not fully ſatisfied, but ſtrange thoughts aroſe in their hearts.

                           <p>So the Spirit by exalting our Native Spirit, exalteth alſo the faculties thereof; and ſo it exalteth our Faith into Knowledg, by making us to know that which before we did believe: And it exalteth our Faith into Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for whereas our Faith was our right to Bleſſedneſs, firm and ſure, the Spirit makes it more firm and more ſure, by confirming and aſſuring that right which was in us before, and which alſo in ſome meaſure was firm and ſound before.</p>
                           <p>Whence by the way we may take notice, That the Spirit is not the cauſe or means of our juſtifying, or of our right to Bleſſedneſs; for we are not juſtified becauſe or by means of the Spirit; but contrarily our juſtifying or right to Bleſſedneſs, is the cauſe or means of the Spirit: For becauſe or by means of our juſtifying, we receive the Spirit; ſo that the Spirit follows after our juſtifying or right to Bleſſedneſs, and goes before our poſſeſſion of it, for it is that preſent Aſſurance, which God maketh unto us.</p>
                           <p>And the Reaſons why the Spirit is our Aſſurance, are chiefly three.<note place="margin">Aſſurance.</note>

                           <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Ability.</note> Becauſe the Spirit is an Ability in us to perform the condition of Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                           <p>The Condition whereupon we are to poſſeſs Bleſſedneſs is Reſipiſcence, or Repentance; <hi>i. e.</hi> an after-wiſdom, whereby we withdraw our love and affections from vanity and earthly things, to ſettle them upon Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and things Heavenly. For thus runneth the Tenour of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; i. e.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2.</note> Bleſſedneſs is at hand, as it was preached by <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>Repentance then is the ſummary precept of the New Teſtament, and the precepts of a Teſtament are the conditions, upon which the Legacies or Promiſes are to be claimed and poſſeſſed.</p>
                           <p>Now if this Precept or Condition of the New Teſtament be impoſſible to be performed, it will thereupon follow that it is fruſtrated and void; becauſe a Condition impoſſible to be performed, makes void the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereunto it is adjoyned, which to ſay of the New Teſtament, is to derogate from the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, who is the Teſtator, and from <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator thereof.</p>
                           <p>But although the Condition of a Teſtament be yokes and burdens, (for it is not againſt reaſon that they ſhould be ſo, ſeeing he who receiveth an excellent benefit, ought in reaſon to bear the burden thereto requiſite) Yet that Condition, which is the burden and yoke of the New Teſtament, is ſo far from being impoſſible, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounceth it eaſy and light. —<hi>For my yoke is eaſie, and my Burden is light.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Math.</hi> 11.30.</note> And to make it the more eaſie and light unto us, God gives us his Holy Spirit, which is a ſuper-natural ability, helping our infirmity for the performance of this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Repentance, and an ability to perform the Condition of a Legacy or Promiſe doth mightily aſſure us of the thing deviſed. The Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is an ability to perform the Condition of Bleſſedneſs, muſt needs be unto us an Aſſurance for Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſecond Reaſon why the Spirit is our Aſſurance for Bleſſedneſs,<note place="margin">Seal.</note> is, becauſe the Spirit is a Seal for our preſent right to Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                           <p>Unto Charters, Feofments, Teſtaments, and other evidences made for
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49664:256"/> the conveyance of Rights, there is annexed a Seal for the more aſſurance of the deed; becauſe the Seal is a witneſs to the Deed, and the principal witneſs thereunto, as the Feoffer or Teſtator acknowledgeth in the final clauſe, where he ſaith, <hi>In witneſs whereof I have hereunto ſet my Hand and Seal.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, the two Teſtaments of God, as in themſelves they are different, ſo they have different Seals. For unto the Old Teſtament the Seal was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which made an impreſſion upon the fleſh: For when God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a right to the Land of <hi>Canaan, Abraham</hi> accepting it by his Faith, received Circumciſion as a Seal for the right:<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ro.</hi> 4.11.</note> — <hi>And he received the ſign of Circumciſion, a Seal for the Righteouſneſs</hi> (i. e. of the Right) <hi>of Faith, which</hi> (Right) <hi>he had yet being uncircumciſed.</hi> But unto the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Seal is the Holy Spirit, which makes an Impreſſion upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit of Believers. For hence Believers after their believing are ſaid to be ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</note> —<hi>In whom after that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> And by the ſame Spirit they are ſealed unto the day of Redemption:<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30.</note> — <hi>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God by which ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> And God ſets this Seal in witneſs of our Alliance with him as his Sons and Heirs: —<hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.16.</note> 
                              <hi>that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; and if Children, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and Joint-heirs with Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And hence alſo it appears, that the Seal of the New Teſtament is ſo much better than that of the Old, by how much an Inſpiration upon Man's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is better than a Circumciſion of the fleſh? Seeing then the Spirit is a Seal of our preſent Right to Bleſſedneſs, therefore it is an Aſſurance unto us for Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <note place="margin">Earneſt.</note>3. The third and laſt Reaſon why the Spirit is an Aſſurance for Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is becauſe the Spirit is an Earneſt for our future poſſeſſion of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Upon the Donation of a preſent Right, where there is not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent delivery of the thing given, as is done in all Promiſes, there the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture poſſeſſion of the thing is commonly aſſured by an Earneſt, which is ſomething given in hand for the preſent, inſtead of the thing to come, as a pledg or pawn for the future poſſeſſion of it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.17, 18.</note>So when <hi>Judah</hi> had promiſed <hi>Tamar</hi> to ſend her a kid from the flock, he left in her hand his Signet, his Bracelet and his Staff, by way of Earneſt or pledg until his delivery of the kid, where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for pledg, ſignifies an Earneſt.</p>
                           <p>And ſo upon a Contract of future Marriage, a Ring or piece of gold is given by way of earneſt to aſſure the future conſummation of it.</p>
                           <p>In the New Teſtament God hath promiſed unto us the inheritance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bleſſedneſs, whereto by Faith we have a preſent right; but becauſe we have not a preſent poſſeſſion of that inheritance: Therefore God gives us his earneſt to aſſure our future poſſeſſion of that inheritance. And the earneſt which he gives us is his Holy Spirit,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</note> whereby he worketh us for the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof. —<hi>Now, he that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who alſo hath given us the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 122.</note> And that very Spirit which is a Seal to our Spirit, is alſo an Earneſt in our Hearts. —<hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> And that poſſeſſion for which the Holy Spirit is both a Seal and an Earneſt, is the Inheritance of Bleſſedneſs.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</note> —<hi>In whom alſo after ye believed ye were ſealed with that Holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our Inheritance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="465" facs="tcp:49664:256"/>
                           <p>And of that Inheritance, the Spirit is the Earneſt until the poſſeſſion be delivered unto us; for unto the words laſt cited thus immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Thus the Spirit is an Aſſurance for Bleſſedneſs, becauſe it is an ability to perform the condition of it; a Seal for our preſent Right to it, and an Earneſt for our future poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. We may not think uncharitably,<note place="margin">Collections. Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs.</note> that every one that is not of our Sect, though he be an honeſt Man and feareth God, is a Reprobate: by the ſame uncharitable Rule they may think the ſame of us, who differ juſt as much from us as we do from them, and are as confident of their being in the right, as we are of our being in the right.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We may not think, that our judgment of our own Eſtate, or our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies judgment of our Eſtate, ſhall be the rule by which God will proceed to judg, both us and them at the laſt day.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We may not think of our ſelves or others, that when we or they have honeſtly and conſtantly endeavoured after goodneſs, and come ſhort of what is indeed perfection, therefore we ſhall be all rejected, and left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der woful diſappointments; God is not ſo hard a Maſter.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. We may not think that every one that in heat of paſſion deſpairs, or makes away himſelf is loſt for ever, or every Mad-man or Fool is damned: Theſe have no Will, and therefore no ſin for the time; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſuffer juſtly for ſuch actions, but for what they did while they were themſelves, if ever they were ſo. If never, they are ſufferers not Sinners; no ſhame to them, but for God's Glory.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. We may not think that every one that boaſts of his Aſſurance is ſure, and of his Perfection is perfect: There is cauſe to ſuſpect ſuch moſt, who leaſt ſuſpect themſelves.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The Cares and Loves of God, are not altogether without ſome fears and jealouſies. <hi>Pietas etiam tuta aliquindo pertimeſcit:</hi> Piety, though in a ſafe condition, is now and then fearful. The liberal Man miſtruſteth his Bounty. The Believer his Unbelief: —<hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi> If this be a fault, it is a ſafe one. Let him that ſtandeth take heed, leſt he fall: —<hi>Be not high minded but fear.</hi> Every Man hath not a Manſion in Heaven that pretendeth to it, nor is every Man ſhut out who doubteth of his evidence for Heaven. Diffidence is a character of a good Man, who would fain be better: Though he hath built up his Aſſurance as ſtrong as he can, yet he thinketh himſelf not ſure enough, but ſeeketh farther for Aſſurance, and fortifieth it with his fear and aſſiduous diligence
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:49664:260"/> to make it ſtand faſt for ever. The caſe of every one that uſes deſperate words is not deſperate, if they proceed from diſtempers of Body or ignorance of Mind, and not from corrupt conſciences. We may be bold to ſay; If real deſpair hath killed her thouſands, Preſumption hath ſlain her ten thouſands. Deſpair is the Daughter of Sin and Darkneſs; but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is the <hi>ludibrium</hi> of Hope: But holy confidence is the Genuine Off-ſpring of a pure conſcience.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Neglect not the Grace of God, nor receive it in vain, nor turn it unto wantonneſs; nor ſin that Grace may abound. But be vigilant and careful, and wiſely fearful, <hi>Fortis ſaepè victus, cautus rariſſime.</hi> A ſtrong Man over confident, oft falls; but a wary Man ſeldom.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>More I will not venture to ſay: This Aſſurance that we have is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. We have a Calling, and an Election from God for our Salvation. All we have to do is to work out this our Salvation, with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and to make our Calling and Election ſure.</p>
                           <pb n="475" facs="tcp:49664:261"/>
                           <p>This is the greateſt Aſſurance that can be expected, and it is enough.</p>
                           <p>But if we depend upon abſolute Election from all Eternity, and that of ſo very ſmall and inconſiderable a number.<note place="margin">Election.</note> It is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive any comfort to our Souls from thence. For ſtill we may juſtly fear, we are not of the number of thoſe few, and if we be, we are ſure, do what we will, but it is very unlikely: And if we be not, we are utterly loſt, do what we can, and it is very likely. And if our fancy run upon it that we are reprobates, it cannot be ſatisfied to the contrary, little hopes can be expected where there are ſo very few: In vain they bid us believe, that can never believe except we be decreed to believe. But if all be called, as they are, then all may be choſen, as they are not, becauſe they obey not the call; and if all may be choſen, then there is hopes for all. And God is thereby juſtified, and our deſtruction is from our ſelves, and every mouth will be ſtopped. If any body can inform me farther upon this point, and teach me how to ſatisfie my ſelf or others about it better, I ſhall be glad to learn. I am no Dictator to my ſelf or others, but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what I have learned from the Scriptures, I commend to my ſelf and others, to comfort and ſettle me and them in all conditions, eſpecially in the hour of death; that we may live and die hopefully in the Mercies of God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord. And through the tender Mercies of our God we may be ſure that we ſhall never miſcarry. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And therefore that <hi>Allodium</hi> Land is ſaid to be infeudated, or given in fee.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Allodium</hi> is an hereditary Eſtate, which as my own, I may ſell, give away, or otherwiſe convey as I ſhall pleaſe, without the Licence of any Man whatſoever.</p>
                           <p>So things are had, and held either by our own proper and entire right as <hi>Allodium,</hi> or by the right of Benefice of another as a <hi>Feudum,</hi> or by the right of Libel or Copy, when a thing is paſt away for a certain ſumme, but not for ever, as a pure ſale, but for a certain time, reſerving every Year a Penſion or Canon, which <hi>Term</hi> or time may be renew'd upon ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for ever.</p>
                           <p>All things are in their own Nature allodial, and might be acquired and kept juſtly by any Man; but now by cuſtoms introduced into Kingdoms, ſome Lands are held in fee upon courteſie and favour.</p>
                           <p>The Perſons and things that Soveraign Princes do hold,<note place="margin">Crown Lands.</note> they hold in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Allodium</hi> or Right in themſelves, depending upon none: <hi>Quaſi A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lode,</hi> or <hi>ſine laude, cui nec gratia, nec merces, nec opera debetur:</hi> No thanks, reward nor ſervice is due for what they have to any Man.</p>
                           <p>All the Lands in their Kingdoms are their own, but not in their own hands: Theſe that are in their own hands they call Crown Lands, (though the reſt are ſo) becauſe they are reſerved by them for their own honour and maintenance; the reſt in the hands of Subjects own ſervice, as the Subjects themſelves to the King, of whom all hold, and he holds of none.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Allodium</hi> of the Prince is Life, the Sea; as all Waters flow from the Sea, ſo they return to the Sea again. So do Feuds come from the Prince, and return to him again.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>In ſummo gradu poſitus habens Allodium, dat Feudum:</hi> He that is in the higheſt degree having <hi>Allodium,</hi> beſtows Fees.</p>
                           <p>The Emperour is the higheſt Lord of the Eſtates of Lands, Rights and Perſons: Under him are Lords Intermedial.</p>

                           <p>To avoid all Ambiguities and Amphibologies in <hi>Terms,</hi> I declare,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> That the <hi>Habent</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>Tenent</hi> another in ſome ſenſe, and in ſome
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:49664:264"/> ſenſe alſo they are both one. The <hi>habent</hi> is an Abſolute owner and poſſeſſor of goods, and the ſame perſon is alſo the <hi>tenent</hi> of the ſame goods: but in ordinary acception the <hi>habent</hi> is taken for the Lord, and the <hi>tenent</hi> for the Holder under him; the one in his own Right and the other in another Mans: The one the <hi>habent</hi> and <hi>tenent</hi> of his own goods, the other the uſuary and occupier of another Man's goods.</p>
                           <p>Whereas therefore I ſpeake of Tenures, I mean by an abſolute <hi>Allodium,</hi> a Tenure in and from a Mans own ſelf, without acknowledgment of Right or Duty to any Man. And by a Conditional <hi>Feudum,</hi> I mean a Tenure from another Man, with acknowledgment of Right, and ſubjection in and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man. And ſo by this diſtinction, the Diſcourſe may paſs clear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any interfering at all, which I propound as my true meaning in all that I have ſaid, or ſhall ſay upon this ſubject in this Book, and in this whole Volume: And ſo by the Favour of the Learned and candid Reader, I go on, after I have caſt in but one corn of Salt to ſeaſon this large Allegory of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodium</hi> and <hi>Feudum,</hi> as they are apply'd to the Eſtate of God, and of his Church and Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>If all Eſtates were independent, what Society? If all Perſons were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, what rule could there be? What is God but independent? What's a King but independent, from all but God? What are Subjects but ſuch whoſe Perſons and Eſtates depend upon God and the King?</p>
                           <p>They that would be independent would have their Perſons, Actions and their Eſtates to be their own, ſo as none to be Lords over them.</p>
                           <p>But the cauſe is otherwiſe, and, God be thank'd, we are not our own, and our Perſons, actions and Eſtates are not our own, but all for the glory of God and the King, and for the good of the Church and all Mankind.</p>
                           <p>It is certainly the beſt condition for us to ſtand in Relation and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to God and the King. But the proud hearts of the Sons of Men would have it otherwiſe, if they could; and this Spirit raiſes up all the rebellions in the World. Becauſe we would be gods to our ſelves, and kings to our ſelves, and prieſts to our ſelves, and ſo deſtroy our ſelves, if we had our wills.</p>
                           <p>Let God therefore, as he is, be the Abſolute Liege Lord of the World, his allodial Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>Let Kings, as they are, be the <hi>Quaſi</hi>-Abſolute Liege Lords of the World, their <hi>Quaſi</hi>-allodial Eſtate.</p>

                           <p>This Grant is made by the Lord or Patron freely, for pure love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration of Mony, or other reward at all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Feudum</hi> is a kind of <hi>Clientele,</hi> by which the Client puts himſelf and his heirs, under the protection of his Lord and Patron and his heirs for ever, to love and reverence him and his, and to defend him and all his in their lives, honours and fortunes; upon the performance of which conditions the Fee is ſure to him and his heirs for ever: So was it not by the moſt ancient Cuſtomes, but the Feudatary was ſo abſolutely in his Lord's power, that when he pleaſed he might take away the Fee that he had given him without rendring a reaſon.</p>
                           <p>The higheſt <hi>Feudum,</hi> is to the higheſt Liege Lords. This is for a man freely to put himſelf and all his family into the Clientele of his Liege-Lord againſt all other Lords whatſoever: and this he doth meerly for love, and binds himſelf by ſolemn Oath upon his knees to keep his faith and love to his Lord in all things,</p>
                           <p>So Love is the foundation of <hi>Feudum.</hi> This provokes the Patron to bounty, and the Client to love and ſervice. If he deſpiſe his Lords love, or be any waies ungrateful, he is deprived of his Benefice.</p>
                           <p>So Faith is the form of <hi>Feudum.</hi> He that holds in Fee holds humbly, honeſtly, lovingly, ſerviceably in eternal obligation.</p>
                           <p>The Reaſons why the Vaſſal ſhould love his Lord, are,
<list>
                                 <item>1. Becauſe he gives him all he hath.</item>
                                 <item>2. Becauſe he loves him and protects him.</item>
                              </list>

                           <pb n="482" facs="tcp:49664:265"/>
                           <p>The Fee is granted by the Lord meerly of Grace, and is grace, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal grace, freely given <hi>ex mero motu.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Vaſſal is juſtified by the Lord meerly of Grace, by the means of the Vaſſals faith given to his Lord.</p>
                           <p>The Vaſſal and the Lord do afford mutual help and counſel to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as friends.</p>
                           <p>In humane Feuds the Vaſſal only ſwears Fealty, but in divine the Lord himſelf ſwears. The Oath of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> was an oath of Fealty, for therein God ſwears to perform his Promiſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> to perform his Faith given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to give him a right of Inheritance, Iſſue and Alliance, and now he ſwears to be true to him, and to be as good as his word. See here the faithfulneſs of God, and wonder at his graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: When the Lord ſwears fealty to his Homager, the God of heaven ſwears fealty to a Man of Duſt; and when the ſame man was diſſolved into duſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.16.</note> 
                              <hi>God was not aſhamed to be called his God, becauſe he had prepared for him a City.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In a Liege Fee the Tenant ſwears fidelity to his Lord <hi>nullo excepto,</hi> nor is any Repentance admitted for him to go back from his obedience ſworn.</p>
                           <p>In other Feuds the Vaſſal may <hi>refutare feudum &amp; fidem datam reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> and be judged by his Peers; but not in a Liege feud, but by the Prince only. Becauſe in this Fee the Vaſſal principally obliges his own Perſon, and ſo his goods follow, by which it comes to paſs that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Liege Man to two Lords,<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> for <hi>no man can ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Again, <hi>Feudum</hi> is a right in another mans Goods, that is, a right of Uſufruct, which conſiſts not in a mans own goods: And this Right is given to this end, that he that hath it ſhould do ſervice to the owner; for no man can ſerve himſelf.</p>
                           <p>This Tenure had its original from Law, and to create Law.</p>

                           <p>And thus there is a very near Relation created, by this ſolemn homage, between the Lord and his Vaſſal.</p>
                           <p>The like whereunto and more ſolemn is ſeen in Baptiſm, wherein we engage to renounce the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſts Banner againſt them, and to continue his faithful Souldiers and Servants unto our lives end.</p>
                           <p>In this Covenant there is a mutual obligation between both Parties; for the Lord that expects faith from his Vaſſal, is bound to perform his own faith to him again. <hi>Nam quod quiſque juris in alium ſtatuit, eodem &amp; ipſe uti debet,</hi> Look what Right a man hath ordained to another, the ſame ought he to uſe.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. Some he gives to the Church, as the <hi>Lombards</hi> firſt did, when they became Chriſtians; and ſo the Clergy firſt became Lords, and by them were conſtituted one of the three Eſtates, which was more than ever <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did, or any other Chriſtians.</p>

                           <p n="7">7. Thoſe that had no Fees (called <hi>Cenſiti,</hi>) were the old Natives living in Villages, confined to till the ground. The Feudataries were called Tenants, the reſt Reſidents, or Reſients, as our Law calls them.</p>
                           <p>No Tenure makes more for the honour and ſafety of the Prince, or for the liberty and ſecurity of the Subject than this does.</p>
                           <p>No Subject can ſay, I am of my ſelf; I thank no man for my Lands; I am beholding to no man, for all muſt thank the King. The Subject holds by the grace of the King, and the King only by the grace of God.</p>
                           <p>Princes and Subjects of old, <hi>Jure Romano,</hi> were obliged to each other for the Common good, but not in ſo ſtrict a tye as this is, which they learned by the Examples of the <hi>Longobardian</hi> Kings, the firſt creatours of Dependance by Law, in granting out their Lands to their Subjects in Fee.</p>
                           <p>The old <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> had ſomething like unto this way, but not the ſame; as <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who let the marches of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Kingdoms, <hi>Capitaneis Ducibus,</hi> calling thoſe Lands <hi>Limotrophi,</hi> given to them only at firſt, afterward to them and their heirs, upon this account of policy, <hi>Dicentes illos attentiùs militaturos ſi etiam ſua jura de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenderent,</hi> Souldiers would fight with more courage in the defence of their own Rights.</p>
                           <p>I know not by what inſtinct (for I cannot tell how the <hi>Lombards</hi> in the latter times of the World ſhould meerly ſtumble upon it) this Tenure came into the World, but I am ſure when it did come it did much good therein, and was entertained by thoſe Nations, that counted themſelves far more wiſe, and learned, and pious than they.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. One Faith and Obedience in all.</p>

                           <p n="8">8. For Peace; they cannot fight one againſt another, nor all of them againſt their King, nor their King againſt them. The Subjects loſe all if they ſtir in the leaſt to make any diſturbance. They cannot invade each other, for each hath his lot.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. For Love; they muſt love their Lord, and their Lord them, and they one another, or they are all nothing.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. For Plenty; they all labour to enrich themſelves, and ſo the whole. No Taxes or odious burthens; they enrich not their Lord at all, for all is his already: yet they have their benefits to themſelves, but the honour only and dominion is his.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. For Dependence; they cannot be without their Lord, nor their Lord without them. They ſubſiſt by him, he by them.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. For Obedience; they come and go at the Princes beck, they do all he commands them.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. For Covenant; the King is in Covenant with his Subjects, and his Subjects with him.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. For Honour; the King honours the Subjects, and the Subjects him.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. For Juſtice; no robbery or oppreſſion of the King or Subject in all this Kingdom. Every one enjoys his own Fee; the ſame things to be had of the King, the ſame duties to be done by the Subjects.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. For War; <hi>Omnia Feuda ad Militiae ſubventionem &amp; expeditionem inventa ſunt,</hi> All Fees are invented for help and expedition of Warfare.</p>

                           <p>This rare Invention and form of Government deſerves thanks and praiſe, and hath it from underſtanding men.<note place="margin">Goths <hi>and</hi> Vandals.</note> Witneſs the reception of their Cuſtomes, and adding others in imitation of them by the wiſeſt Nations of the World; and amongſt them our own is not a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them, whoſe fundamental frame of Monarchy was contrived from thoſe that had it derived unto them from the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> for ſuch were the <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> from whom we and our Feudal Laws do ſpring, though the fountain be almoſt loſt for want of Enquiry, and the waters troubled by Pride and Rebellion, which the Feudal Laws do moſt abhor and controul.</p>
                           <p>But why do I magnifie theſe <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> Heathens, ignorant and barbarous men. Can any good thing come out of the North? Look to their Cuſtomes and Tenures. Peradventure ſome may ſay, They have exceeded all the Cuſtomes and Tenures that ever were in the World.</p>
                           <p>Neither are thoſe Nations altogether to be deſpiſed, becauſe they had not the ſyſtems of Arts and Sciences, according to the mode of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Natural Rules of Juſtice and Honeſty were well underſtood and practiſed by them, as appears by their Laws and Cuſtomes.<note place="margin">

                           <p>The Pride of the <hi>Romans</hi> was great, and theſe men did pull it down to ſome purpoſe, but never ſet up the like of their own.</p>
                           <p>While they were at home, they lived quietly and honeſtly; but when they came abroad into a fatter ſoil, they plaid mad pranks, as others that have higher thoughts, uſe to do.</p>
                           <p>When they raviſhed the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they committed cruel acts of Hoſtility, as wiſer people uſed to do; but after they had ſetled their Conqueſts, and were conquered themſelves by Chriſtianity, they grew more honeſt, civil, zealous and bountiful than other Conquerors uſed to be.</p>

                           <p>Now, if ever, was the trial of thoſe men, when they had poſſeſſion of the honours and riches of the World. I pray what were the <hi>Romans</hi> in the height of their Glories and Majeſties, but Monſters of Swiniſh, Goatiſh, and Wolviſh tempers, ſtrutting in all Luxurious wantonneſs, and wallowing in blood and gore?

                           <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were Heathens at firſt, and not over honeſt, yet their Laws were ſpecial good; and though their Empire be down, yet they are in full force and vigour to this day.

                              <note place="margin">Jus Feudale.</note> and are in force amongſt all the learned Nations of the World; though their Empire be down alſo.

                           <p>
                              <hi>Theodorick</hi>'s Laws found more in <hi>France</hi> than <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> many of them are taken into the Capitular of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and the Decrees of <hi>Ivo,</hi> and are the fountain of the Laws of <hi>Spain.</hi> But the Feudal Cuſtomes run through all Nations.</p>

When <hi>Alaricus</hi> took <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſaved the lives and liberties of all that took Sanctuary, with the Churches and ſacred Utenſils, for which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Oroſius</hi> highly commend them, the like did <hi>Totilas.</hi> How was <hi>Rome</hi> ſaved, upon the Petition of the Biſhop thereof, from being ſacked, when it was in their power? And how they did behave themſelves after their Conqueſts in <hi>Italy,</hi> appears plainly, in that no one City revolted of their own accord from the <hi>Gothes,</hi> to the Captains of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> And in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> amongſt the <hi>Vandals</hi> no Seditions aroſe, as did preſently when the <hi>Romans</hi> prevailed.</p>
                           <p>Other Nations plaid mad pranks of Rebellion in their own Countries, ſo did not they, which is not a little to their honour, and to the honour of other Nations that are called Barbarous, and makes greatly to the ſhame and diſgrace of the Impropriators of Gentility, Learning, and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

                           <p>The nature of Man aſpires to be as God, ſole and abſolute in their perſons and eſtates as Kings, Gods to themſelves.

                           <p>But the Tenure of Feuds teaches us humility, to depend upon God for all, to be nothing in our ſelves, and to have nothing but what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; of Grace altogether, not of Debt, therefore no <hi>Allodium,</hi> no boaſting in the caſe.

                           <p n="3">3. In a Feudal kingdom every Subject muſt love and ſerve his Prince, in other Kingdoms every Subject may be forced to ſerve and fear, but not to love his Prince.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In a Feudal kingdom every Subject muſt love his Prince or he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live, but in other kingdoms, the Subjects may hate their Prince and yet live.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. In other kingdoms the Subjects may eat as good meat, and drink as good drink, and wear as good clothes as their Prince, and not care for
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:49664:270"/> him, nor give him no thanks at all, becauſe they live by him and under him, but not of him; but in a Feudal kingdom they have their portion allotted them, and they muſt thank their Lord for all, becauſe they live by him, and under him, and of him.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. In other kingdoms, Kings are glad to beg of their Subjects in their neceſſities for their Subjects good; but in this kingdom Subjects muſt beg of their Kings, for their Kings honour and their own good.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. In other kingdoms Kings cannot live without their Subjects, in this Subjects cannot live without their Kings.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. In other kingdoms, Kings make their Subjects fear them and ſerve them whether they will or no; but here Kings make their Subjects love them and ſerve them freely with a good will.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. In other kingdoms Subjects con their Kings no thanks for what they have, they care as little for their Prince as their Prince careth for them; but in this they muſt be thankful and regardful, or elſe they muſt pack and be gone. A bold <hi>Benjamite</hi> dare blow a Trumpet, and proclaim to his fellow Subjects, <hi>We have no part in David, neither have we inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Son of Jeſſe, Every man to his tents O Iſrael;</hi> but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Kingdom teacheth better manners.</p>

Let him give me my due reſpect, and I will give him his, theres one for the other; They dare conteſt and be upon terms with him, they care no more for him than he cares for them. They ſee no reaſon but that every Lord may write himſelf I <hi>N. N.</hi> by the grace of God, Lord of ſuch a Mannor, as well as the King (God bleſs him) I <hi>N.

                           <p n="11">11. In other Kingdoms Subjects can eaſily rebel, and be too hard for him, as the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> were too hard for <hi>David:</hi> But here Subjects cannot ſo eaſily rebel, for if they do they immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. In other kingdoms Subjects will thruſt in to make Laws; but here the Prince makes all the Laws.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. In ſome kingdoms the People elect their King, but in this the King elects his People.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. In ſome kingdoms, the King ſtipulates pitifully and below him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Subjects; but in this, the Subjects capitulate honourably with their King.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. In other kingdoms, the King cannot ſubſiſt without his People; but in this the People cannot ſubſiſt without the King.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. In ſome kingdoms, Kings rob and ſpoil their Subjects; but in this, Subjects are enriched by their Prince.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. In other kingdoms, the King is defended by his Subjects; but in this, the Subjects are wholly defended by their King.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. In other kingdoms, Subjects are half in half; but in this, the King is all in all.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. In other kingdoms, the People are ſaid to be greater than the King; but in this, the King is greater than the People.</p>

                              <pb n="494" facs="tcp:49664:271"/>20. In other kingdoms Kings impart their Soveraignty to their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but in this the King imparts no Soveraignty, but keeps all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God is a jealous God, and will not give his honour to another. No Vicar General, no Vicegerent in this kind in the Church or Kingdom of Chriſt and of God.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. In other kingdoms Kings are vaſtly cheated every day by their houſhold Servants, Publicans, and all ſorts of Officers; but here God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cheated, he is not a man that he ſhould be deluded.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. In other kingdoms, Kings muſt be counſelled by their Subjects; but here the Subjects are wholly adviſed by their Prince, and who hath been Gods Counſellor at any time, who doth all things according to the Counſel of his own will.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. In other kingdoms, Subjects will dare to call their Kings to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but here the King will be ſure to call all his Subjects to an account.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. In other kingdoms, Subjects give gifts to their Kings; but here the King gives gifts to his Subjects.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. In all other kingdoms, Kings never make their Subjects Kings; but here the King makes all his Subjects Kings, to reign under him, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. In all other Inheritances there can be but one Heir <hi>in toto &amp; in ſolido;</hi> but here all are Heirs <hi>in toto &amp; in ſolido.</hi> The Inheritance <hi>ex Aſſe</hi> being multiplied to all, without diminution to any.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. In other kingdoms Kings may give to thoſe that love them not, but hate them; but this King gives to none but thoſe that love him. The Sons of men are rebellious, the Sons of God are all obedient every one of them.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. In other kingdoms Subjects are all but Nominal; but in a Feudal kingdom (as Chriſts is all along here meant) Subjects are all real.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. In other kingdoms, Subjects do what they liſt, and what is right in their own eyes; but in this, the King doth what pleaſeth him both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. To this King, his Feudal Subjects may truly ſay (ſo as no other can) All that is ours is thine, and all that is thine is ours, and we our ſelves are thine, and thou thy ſelf art ours; yet thou art all things, and haſt all things without us, but we are nothing, and have nothing without thee. Thy riches are ours, thy wiſdom is ours, thy beauty, honour and glory is ours; but thine by property, but ours by grace and favour.— <hi>All things are ours, and we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. —And if God hath given us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>By Faith and Love <hi>we are in God, and God in us, one with Chriſt and Chriſt one with us. For God is love, and he that loveth dwelleth in God and God in him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="31">31. In other kingdoms, Kings ſwear to be faithful to their Subjects; but in a Feudal kingdom, Subjects only ſwear fidelity to their Kings.</p>
                           <p>Yet God himſelf vouchſafes to ſwear,—<hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, that I will never fail David.</hi> And it is no waies improper for a Prince or Lord to ſwear to be faithful to his Subjects, as well as for Subjects to be faithful to their Lords.

                           <p n="32">32. In other kingdoms, Kings tax their Subjects to bear the charge of their Government; but in this, the King bears all the burthen, and the Subjects are at no charges at all. —<hi>of his fullneſs we all receive, grace for grace.</hi>

                           <p n="34">34. In a Feudal kingdom, there is but one ſupream Lord; ſo in Gods kingdom.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. There are many Intermedial Lords, but all Vaſſals to the ſupream Lord: ſo in Gods kingdom, <hi>there are Gods many, and Lords many,</hi> as Kings and Rulers, but all Vaſſals to the ſame ſupream Lord. Yet they may not <hi>Lord it over Gods Inheritance,</hi> no more than Feudal Lords may Lord it over the Kings inheritance.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. The Inheritance of the Fee is equal to all in Gods kingdom, yet not ſo in mans, for ſome have more in Fee, and ſome leſs.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. The Inheritance of the Fee is conditional to all in Man's kingdom, ſo alſo in God's kingdom.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. Some have gifts more than others in Gods kingdom, extrinſecal to their Inheritance of Fee, for the benefit of the Subjects. The Spirit of God divideth to every one his portion, ſome more, ſome leſs, to all ſome, as he pleaſes.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. The way of Inveſtiture is alike to all by Sacrament, or Oath of Fidelity and Homage. All holding in one and the ſame Faith and Love to one Lord.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. No faith and love to any by Imputation, but inherent in every Subject for his Juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="41">41. No faith and love deſcendeth to any by Inheritance, but is perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and individual in all. Every man being faithful and loving for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and God faithful and loving to all and for all.</p>
                           <p n="42">42. All Fees alike in Nature, though of different degrees.</p>

                           <p>The nature and excellency of a Feudal Government,<note place="margin">Excellency of a Feudal Government.</note> may plainly be diſcerned by what hath been obſerved thereof, and more by comparing it with the old <hi>Roman</hi> way of Rule.</p>
                           <p>For, whereas by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, all obligation between Prince and Subjects was upon the conſideration of the Common good only; after that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours had by the example of the <hi>Longobardian</hi> Kings granted their Lands in Fee, then a more ſtrong tye was twiſted between the Lords and their Vaſſals, for the Benefices granted to thoſe Vaſſals and their Families; and inſtead of bare obedience, generally due from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Superiors, love and fidelity was introduced by ſolemn Oath and Covenant, for the Vaſſals to perform all things which concerned the dignity, ſafety and profit of their Lords; and to keep the Peace amongſt
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:49664:272"/> themſelves, and to help one another, and altogether to ſerve their King.</p>
                           <p>Many other things different from the Civil Law were found out, as the Cuſtomes of <hi>Millain</hi> the moſt ancient, then the Laws made by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, <hi>Lotharius, Frederick,</hi> and others, by the advice of Biſhops, Dukes and Marqueſſes, Earls Palatine, Judges and other Nobles, in which, if any thing was wanting, they had recourſe to the Civil Law for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as is uſual at this day; becauſe, though the Civil Law is not of force to overcome Cuſtomes, yet the learned in thoſe Laws, if a Caſe occur which is not contained in the cuſtome of the Fee, may ſafely give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel by the written Law.</p>
                           <p>After the expulſion of the <hi>Longobardian</hi> Kings, the Emperour was the ſupream Lord, with ſupream Legiſlation and Juriſdiction in all Cauſes. And to him Allegiance was due from all his Liege People, by which they were obliged for their Goods, Perſons and Protection, to their ſupream Lord. Than which a better conſtitution never was, nor peradventure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be made, for the reſemblance and nearneſs which it hath to the government of God and of Chriſt.</p>

                           <p>Now where is glory, but in the Donor, whoſe Grace it is? Where is Merit? the Lord doth not thank the Vaſſal that ſerves him, he is reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it; it is his duty, he holds his Fee upon it.</p>
                           <p>Note, that the Lord hath given the Fee, therefore he will not take it away without the fault of the Receiver. Note, that this is a noble way of giving.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To give the Uſe only, not the Dominion.</p>
                           <p>For this keeps up Soveraignty, and maintains obedience and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, fear and love, duty and diſtance.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To give the Uſufruct and all the profit, argues greatneſs, ſufficiency, nobleneſs and liberality. God hath enough, he keeps the Title to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and gives the benefit to his Clients.</p>
                           <p>Fee-farm Rents, Canons for <hi>Emphyteuſis,</hi> Penſions, Homages, are noble Tenures from Lords and Princes Eccleſiaſtical and Civil.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To give this upon condition of Service and Love, not to gratifie and enrich Rebels, nor meer ſlaviſh ſervice, but loving duty and true fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                           <p>This Chriſt learned, —<hi>For though he were a Son, yet learned he obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> Salvation is from God, though we ſerve for it, as it is fit we ſhould do.</p>
                           <p>To give to lazy, rebellious, unthankful Servants is not Royal nor Prince-like.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a wiſe as well as gracious way of Donation.</p>

                           <p>For a Prince to give is honourable.</p>
                           <p>For a Subject to ſerve a Prince is honourable, and for all our Lands and Honours we hold of him, much more honourable.</p>
                           <p>To ſerve the King of Kings is honourable, and for our Inheritance and Honours we hold of him, much more honourable.</p>

                           <p>That they ſhould have them by faith, and hold them by love and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to their Benefactor, is noble.</p>
                           <p>That the King ſhould give them in Fee, both lands and honours, and let them enjoy them though they love and ſerve him not for his grace is diſhonourable, and no wiſe Donation.</p>
                           <p>That the King ſhould force them to accept and hold them whether they will or no, is diſhonourable.</p>
                           <p>That the King ſhould force them to be faithful, loving and obedient whether they will or no, that they might hold them whether they will or no, it is not in his power, it is diſhonourable and unwiſe.</p>
                           <p>So that all ſhould be God's, is noble.</p>
                           <p>So that God ſhould give all but his Royalty, is noble.</p>
                           <p>That the benefit of all things ſhould be to his Creatures and Subjects, is noble.</p>
                           <p>That they ſhould have this benefit by their Faith and Acceptance only, and Covenanting with him, and hold it by their love and ſervice to him, is noble and ſtately.</p>
                           <p>That God ſhould give his People ſuch profits and honours, to let them enjoy them though they love him not, nor uſe what is given them, nor ſerve him at all for all his grace and mercy to them, is diſhonourable and baſe.</p>
                           <p>That the King ſhould have all power in himſelf, is noble.</p>
                           <p>That the King ſhould maintain his kingdom, <hi>i. e.</hi> his lands, honours and Subjects, is noble.</p>
                           <p>That the Subjects ſhould fight for their King that ſo maintains them, is noble.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt is this King, and he hath all power.</p>
                           <p>He maintains his kingdom.</p>
                           <p>His Subjects fight for him, and under him, againſt Satan and his Subjects under him.</p>
                           <p>Chriſts kingdom is a Military kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Chriſts kingdom holds of God in Fee, owes love and homage therefore.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt having adminiſtred his kingdom, ſhall deliver it up, and all its profits, honours and Subjects, to God the Father.</p>
                           <p>That God may be all in all.</p>
                           <p>So Chriſt, as Mediator, holds in Fee.</p>
                           <p>So Chriſtians under him hold of him.</p>
                           <p>As Nobles and inferiour Lords hold all of the King.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt is faithful in his office.</p>
                           <p>They that are Chriſts, are faithful in their offices.</p>
                           <p>God is the King and ſupream Lord.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Who hath the Supreme honour, and Legiſlative power and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to give Laws, and Rules and Titles of Renown.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Thus we ſee where Subjection lodges.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Who have the Revenues as Tenants and Uſufructuaries.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Who have the derived Honours, and Juriſdictions to receive Laws and give them to others with Titles of Dignity.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thus ſwearing Fidelity and making Faith to their Lords, juſtifies the Vaſſals, or gives them right to the Fee.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Thus doing the will of their Lord, ſanctifies them, or keeps their right unto them, and holds them in the Fee.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Thus the Souldiers of Chriſt have a Feudal Right of Uſufruct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon Grace, not an <hi>Allodium</hi> of Abſolute Dominion, which ows no thanks or ſervice to any.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Thus in Feudal Rule, there is no <hi>Jus publicum</hi> by Policy, to do wrong to private Men for the publick good, but a Paternal Government, the Publick Father uſing the perſons and poſſeſſions of his Children, which are all under his power, doing wrong to none for the publick good.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Thus every Child hath his portion, more or leſs given him of his Father, according to which talent he expecteth improvement, for their own enrichment, and the publick well-fare and flouriſhing of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>So that there can be no idle loyterers, nor unprofitable Servants in this Vine-yard: For if ſo, they forfeit what they had by breaking their Faith.</p>
                           <p>All are Children, and therefore free, living under the Law of a Father, which is Love, whoſe will is Righteouſneſs, and their wills agreeable to his deeds; and they that are Faithful in a little, he will reward with much.</p>

                           <p>This is the Corporation and Kingdom of Saints, God is ſtyl'd the King of Saints, and Chriſt the King under God, of whoſe fulneſs we all receive, and Grace for Grace.</p>
                           <p>Here is nothing but free Grace in God, and free Love to one another; Fidelity to God, and honeſty to one another. A Spiritual warfare, victory and triumph: <hi>Satan's Kingdom deſtroy'd, and he bruiſed under every one of our feet, and we more than Conquerors.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus the Feudataries of Spiritual and Eternal Bleſſedneſs, do partake of the Common Rights of Creation and Providence in Temporals, with other Men that are not of God's Kingdom. And they learn to uſe the World, as though they uſed it not: Minding their Spiritual war-fare and ſervice for the Kingdom of Heaven, to which they have a preſent right, and in which they ſhall be inſtalled and enthroned by Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Thus they are not frighted and caſt down with dangers, nor tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and elevated with proſperities as the unrighteous are, becauſe they ſeek another Countrey which is above.</p>
                           <p>Thus the Fleſh is as weak in them as in others, and as prone naturally to exceſs in carnal things; but by the warfare of the Spirit, the Fleſh is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and crucified, and the World and the Devil are overcome, through Chriſt that ſtrengthens them.</p>
                           <pb n="499" facs="tcp:49664:273"/>
                           <p>It is a ſign therefore of a worldly Souldier to fight for the things of this World, and doubtleſs they have their reward: But the Souldier of Chriſt is abſtemious in all thoſe things, and aims at higher matters. The World is for temporals, the Church for Eternals: <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty for the beating down of the ſtrong holds of Sin and Satan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The worldling is wholly buſie in the matters of this World, and toils himſelf to death, with pains and care in them. But the Spiritual Souldier under Chriſts Banner, aims at glorious things, and goes on to perfection. He looks beyond the gayeties and anxieties of this Life, <hi>at the mark of the price of the high Calling which is laid up for him in Chriſt Jeſus, and having an eye to the recompenſe of the Reward, and a hope of a glorious and bleſſed immortality, he is contented to endure the Croſſes, and deſpiſe the ſhames of this World, and purifies himſelf and is zealous of good works, perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of the Lord, that he may obtain an inheritance among them that are ſanctified by Faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To the King alone the faithful make all their Prayers, not to the Saints their Brethren, beneficiaries and fellow Servants, under one Maſter and Benefactor.</p>
                           <p>They can merit nothing at their Lord's hands, for they are Clients and Beneficiaries, depending wholly upon his Grace and Favour.</p>
                           <p>They are all of the ſame Mind, and of the ſame Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The Lord loves his Vaſſal, and the Vaſſal his Lord.</p>
                           <p>Thus all Feudal Rights are retained till there be a <hi>Deſertio militiae,</hi> a laying down Arms, or unthankfulneſs and Rebellion in the caſe.</p>
                           <p>Thus Feudataries are all the Children of their Liege Lord, not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but by Grace, they are all <hi>Filii-familias,</hi> and heirs of his Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>Thus the Feudatary Brethren are all initiated into the Fee of their Lord by a Sacramental Oath, and holy Covenant of Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>Thus they commemorate the bounty of their Lord and Father, by the Sacrament of the Holy Supper; <hi>They eat the ſame Spiritual Bread, and drink the ſame Spiritual Wine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus they entertain one another, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs; for Souldiers muſt be temperate in all things but in <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, in feaſts of Love and Charity.</p>
                           <p>Thus they, as Souldiers, are not entangled with the affairs of this Life, but uſe their Benefices, as not abuſing them, being alwaies watchful, and ſtanding upon their guard to keep out <hi>Satan,</hi> and to bruiſe him under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of their feet.</p>
                           <p>Thus Chriſt hath purchaſed Bleſſedneſs, by conquering Sin, Law, Satan, ſo that all Salvation and Happineſs is his who is the only Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And therefore all that have right, and do hold it to Bleſſedneſs, have it, and hold it of him, who alone hath purchaſed it for them by the price of his precious Bloud, by the Conqueſt of his death: —<hi>For there is no other name given under Heaven whereby we can be ſaved, but only by the Name of</hi> Jeſus.</p>
                           <p>Who is then the Lord &amp; Head of the Church, but Chriſt? What are Saints or Angels? They have all from Chriſt as we, and are our fellow Servants and Brethren partakers of the ſame Grace; and therefore they have merited no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us, nor can they help us, nor may we ſeek to them for help, but with them go to Chriſt; for the participation of the common Salvation had and held by the ſame Right and Title of Faith and Love, till we come
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:49664:274"/> to be perfect, and receive the inheritance with them, which is laid up for us eternal in the Heavens.</p>
                           <p>Though all Feudataries are alike uſufructuaries only, and have and hold of the ſame Liege Lord in the ſame Tenure, yet ſome are Royal and Sacerdotal Dignitaries, others inferior Titularies.</p>
                           <p>So Kings hold next and immediately under God, of Chriſt their King, <hi>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice.</hi> And Prieſts hold from Chriſt <hi>the Great High Prieſt and Biſhop of our Souls.</hi> And Subjects hold under their Kings and Prieſts, who rule them in Temporals and Spiri uals, by Juriſdiction, received from the Supreme Power of Chriſt, who is <hi>the firſt born of God, and higher than the Kings of the Earth, and the Great High Prieſt, by whom we are made both Kings and Prieſts.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He that is imploy'd in another Man's Eſtate, muſt be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, ſo muſt we by Chriſt be called to an accompt at the laſt day for our Stewardſhip of the goods of God.</p>

                           <p>I ſay then that this Tenure of Fealty and love, though invented by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, came by inſtinct from God, and is the pattern of his Fatherly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

                           <p>And for the honourable Tenure of Abſolute propriety to be in every one; it is ſo indeed, as they ſay, honourable. But if ſo, what then more honour could the King himſelf have, but only that he hath, or ſhould have a greater Eſtate than the reſt? And if ſo, many of his Subjects would come up very near him, and all others care little for him, being for what they enjoy, as good every whit as himſelf; and would not this puff up?</p>
                           <p>But as to this, the Subjects of the World have brought it to that paſs, that they have in a manner their deſires, and will be as much Kings of their own Eſtates, as the King himſelf is (God bleſs him) by the Grace of God.</p>
                           <pb n="502" facs="tcp:49664:275"/>
                           <p>For however it was from the Cuſtom of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> which was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and however it ought to be, where thoſe Cuſtoms were made fundamental Laws; yet it is manifeſt that the great Conteſters for liberty, have ſhaken off that yoke of <hi>Norman</hi> as we, or <hi>Northern</hi> bondage as they call it; and yet made themſelves never the freer nor happier by it, but rather more ſlaviſh and miſerable, which now they patiently and deſervedly endure, and are ſilent upon it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have their wills, and brought it upon themſelves. And much good may do them with it; they knew not when they were well, and God knows when they will be better: It is rather feared that by farther depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from this antient Tenure, they will make themſelves worſe and worſe; for thereby they are more and more rebellious, and thereby make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterity more and more miſerable, running ſo long from ſeeming bondage till they unavoidably plunge themſelves really into it.</p>
                           <p>The Name only of Fee is retained, but the Nature of the thing is quite and clean loſt. And a Fee-ſimple, as they call it, though that be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> is an <hi>Allodium</hi> with them.</p>
                           <p>Yet for all this, though the People had gotten Liberty to themſelves indeed, by ſhaking off the yoke of their Fore-Fathers; yet ſtill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Lombards</hi> was good. And ſuppoſing their Lords (as they then prov'd, and might have been ſo ſtill) to be no Tyrants, and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants no Rebels, as they were not and had no cauſe to be: The Lords had love from their Tenants, and their Tenants love to them, and they enjoy'd their Liberty, and their Lands were ſure to them, and to their heirs, if no Rebellion made a forfeit.</p>
                           <p>But now the World is grown prouder it ſhould ſeem, ſince they have grown more learned, and thoſe plain Rules of Honeſty, Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are deſpiſed. But even in this their wiſedoms are befooled, and they forſake their own mercy, and loſe the benefit of that peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they might enjoy; for a humour of ſelf-will and a ſhadow of that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Liberty, infinitely miſtaken in the World, and will not have it be otherwiſe, grutching Kings their power to their own woe, and the People delight to have it ſo.</p>
                           <p>For all this ſpecious pretence of Liberty, it will not out of my Mind, but that, as there is no leſs Freedom, ſo there is much more love and ſafety in this Conſtitution, and more obligation to unity, than in any other. Where the Common Lord is a common Father to his Tenants, who are all fed and taught by him, and brought up together to love and honour him: Whereas other models, he that is an Abſolute Proprietary, is not a Child at all to his Prince, nor ſo much a Subject as he that is a Feudatary; nor is the Prince ſo much Supreme as others are, nor likely to have ſo much love and duty as others have, whoſe Subjects have their whole dependency and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being from them.</p>

                           <p>It is apparent that by this change of Fees into Abſolute Eſtates, though it be very good in it ſelf and agreeable with the Natural Liberty and old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Laws; yet it is not ſo ſafe for general preſervation, according to the Covenant for mutual peace. And thereby the Prince hath not the power he had or ſhould have, nor the Subjects that love and duty they had or ſhould have; but daily encroachments ruſh one upon another, and cut in ſunder the antient Bands of Faith and True Allegiance, make the Prince a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:49664:275"/> and the Subject a Rebel, or at leaſt the Prince, though juſt, muſt be forc'd to rule by the Sword; becauſe the Subjects by being wanton with peace, plenty and priviledges, do ſpurn againſt his power, and rebel againſt his Perſon. Surely, if right Judgment would be taken, a Liege Lord of a Fee is no Tyrant, and a Vaſſal in Fee is no ſlave: For a Slave is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Law, and hath nothing, nor can he do any thing in Law; ſo is not a Feudatary or Liege Man.</p>
                           <p>Well, however Supreme Lords fail of their Lordſhips, and Vaſſals of their duty in Temporal Kingdoms, in this Spiritual Kingdom of God's Church, neither God nor his People can fail of either. And to my poor and weak apprehenſion, there is a great deal of blithe and reſemblance in the features of this Feudal Government, and that of the Church of God, which is all, God knows, I contend for in the caſe. And if I be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, I am where I was, and the Diſſenters where they were before. And therefore no cauſe of falling out at all, for they have their opinion, and I have mine; and God bleſs us all, there is no harm done all this while.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Longobardian</hi> Kings had this Soveraignty above all others, that they were the ſole owners and proprietaries of all the Lands, and left the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to their Subjects. And why ſhould not Kings, who come neareſt to God for power and are gods, have their juſt Rights?</p>
                           <p>But if this be thought hard for Mortal gods and Kings, to have theſe <hi>Quaſi</hi>-prerogatives of God, who can deny the Real Prerogatives of the Moſt High God and Immortal King of Kings?</p>
                           <p>Are not all things his, whether we will or no? And hath he not given them in uſe and profit to the Sons of Men?</p>
                           <p>And is not Bleſſedneſs his, and hath he not given it in uſe and profit to his Faithful ones?</p>
                           <p>It muſt belong to God to be the ſole Owner and Governour of all things in Heaven and Earth.</p>
                           <p>And if Kings be the ſole owners and Governours under God of things on Earth, they are the more like unto God, and the more able to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Benefactors.</p>
                           <p>If the Saints hold of God by the beſt Tenure of Free Grace, then it can be no diſparagement for Vaſſals to hold of their Lords, by the ſame Title.</p>
                           <p>What is better than Faith and Love to God or Man? and he that fails of theſe to his Soveraign is not worthy to have or hold any Benefit by him.</p>
                           <p>If a Tenure be not of Grace but abſolute, it is not thank-worthy to any Man; for none can have the praiſe of it but our ſelves, that are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from all Men; and ſo we truſt to our ſelves, and care for no Man, and ſerve and love our ſelves, and give Laws to our ſelves, and there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt of.</p>
                           <p>But if it be of Grace, it is thank-worthy, and another hath the praiſe, becauſe we depend upon another, which is wiſer and mightier than our ſelves; and this is ſafeſt for us, and therefore we truſt not to our ſelves, but to another; and ſerve not, love not our ſelves for what we have, but another, and receive Laws to our ſelves, and there is nothing to boaſt of.</p>
                           <p>This ſtate muſt needs be the ſafeſt way to create humility and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by aſcribing all Soveraignty to God, and all Subjection to our ſelves. To have all from God, and to hold all from him, that God may have all the glory to own and rule all; and we all the ſafety and benefit under him, that God may be all in all, who becauſe he hath given us Chriſt, hath with him alſo freely given us all things.</p>

                           <p>This ſtate muſt needs be the ſureſt way, becauſe Grace given can never fail on the givers part, who liveth for ever, unleſs the Title of Faith and love for Grace received do fail on our part, which muſt be very great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to God and to our ſelves, in neglecting ſo great Salvation.</p>
                           <p>A Lord gives his Fee to his Vaſſal and his heirs for ever, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it paſſes, till there comes a forfeiture on the Vaſſal's part, for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or other diſobedience, or an <hi>Apertura Feudi,</hi> for want of Heirs.</p>
                           <p>If any of theſe happen ſtill the Grace of the Lord is never leſs than it was before; but the ungraciouſneſs of the Vaſſal is much more, in caſe of ſuch a refuſal. So the Lord of all Lords gives his Grace unto all the Faithful, and accordingly it paſſes, unleſs there be a forfeiture for infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or refuſal, or laying down the <hi>Militia.</hi> And if any of theſe happen, the Grace of God is never leſs than it was before, but the ungraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Creatures is much the more, in caſe of ſuch infidelity and refuſal.</p>

                           <p>How can this be made out otherwiſe, to convince the underſtanding of the Juſtice or Mercy of God, in the Buſineſs of our Damnation or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If we ſay, It is a decree to receive and hold ſome in his Grace and favour for ever,<note place="margin">Abſolute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation.</note> and to reject and keep down others in his wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for evermore: Then farewell all Reaſon or Religion in this kind. I will not think a thought more, nor ſpeak a word, nor write a ſyllable more of this matter.</p>
                           <p>If this be the Faith and the Grace of God, which I muſt have and hold by Fate if I be elected thereto, whether I will or no; and if this be the Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and wrath of God, which I muſt have and hold by Fate, if I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, whether I will or no; then I have done for ever thinking or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or writing of this Subject more.</p>
                           <p>But ſtay: If I muſt be ſilent for ever hereafter, give ſuch a Loſer leave to ſpeak his laſt words; for we uſe not to deny that liberty to the greateſt Malefactors before they die.</p>
                           <p>Was there ever ſuch a Grace or Pardon given by God or Man, that he to whom it is given, ſhould both take it and keep it for his juſtification, whether he will or no?</p>
                           <p>Indeed there is, and that juſtly to a malefactor ſuch a curſe or ſentence of Wrath denounced, that he muſt undergo whether he will or not: But for his Pardon it cannot be: A force upon a Slave patient, not upon a free Agent.</p>
                           <p>Was there ever ſuch a Grace given by God or Man, as to make the Receiver Gracious, and to keep him ſo for his Sanctification whether he will or no?</p>
                           <p>Was there ever ſuch a Curſe of God or Man, as for no cauſe to make the patient ſinful before he was, and when he was, and to keep him ſo for his Condemnation whether he will or no?</p>
                           <p>Is ſuch a Grace, a wiſe Grace, for God or Man to beſtow?</p>
                           <p>Is ſuch an Anger, a wiſe Anger, for God or Man to inflict?</p>
                           <p>Should not Princes do all things wiſely? And muſt not God do all things according to the Counſel of his own Will, and is not he moſt wiſe? And can he deny himſelf, that he ſhould not act wiſely, as well as juſtly and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully?</p>
                           <pb n="505" facs="tcp:49664:276"/>
                           <p>And can we conceive ſuch Actings of God to be his Abſolute Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, contrary to his Abſolute Wiſedom and Goodneſs, meerly to have his own Will and Pleaſure upon us, though it be to the Everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his poor Creatures?</p>
                           <p>Can we imagine that God ſhould ſelect infallibly Veſſels of Mercy, fitted from all Eternity to ſhew the glory of his Grace, and to ſelect Veſſels of miſery from all Eternity, fitted to deſtruction to ſhew the glory of his Juſtice? It had been better the moſt of Men upon whom this Deſtiny hath ſeized, never to have been born, but been like the untimely fruit of a Woman that never ſaw the Sun!</p>
                           <p>How ſhall God provoke us to Reaſon with him upon this point, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his waies be not equal, and our waies inequal? We have reaſon from God, though his Reaſon be infinitely above ours: We may not reply againſt God, but we may modeſtly plead for God. We may not diſpute with God, but we may think honourably of him.</p>
                           <p>And though we cannot underſtand the Reaſons of his workings, yet we can underſtand, That as his waies are often ſecret, ſo they are alwaies juſt; and that the Judg of the World muſt needs do right.</p>
                           <p>Well, I have done upon this Point, I may have leave to think ſtill, though I have promiſed to ſpeak no more: Yet I have not promiſed to forbear ſpeaking reverently of God, that he is infinitely gracious, juſt and holy, above all that I, or all the World are ever able to imagine, or expreſs.</p>
                           <p>And let fierce Men ſay what they pleaſe, I and all the World may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely truſt to the Mercy of God, which will never fail them, if they do not abuſe it; and through the tender compaſſions of the Moſt High, they ſhall be ſure never to miſcarry. Let ſuch miſerable Comforters go whither they will, O my Soul, I charge thee never to enter into their ſecrets in this Thing, and into their counſels let not mine Honour be united.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. The Condition on Chriſts part was his Humiliation, by ſuffering of ſhame, ſorrow, a Curſe, and death. For ſo it was written of him, <hi>in the Volume of the book,</hi> that he ſhould fulfil the will of God, and <hi>Lo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am content to do it.</hi> So when the bitter Cup was given him to drink, after a diſpute, he concludes, <hi>nevertheleſs not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Again, his Condition was to glorifie God, as Gods was to glorifie him. —<hi>Father glorifie thou me, as I have glorified thee. —It behoved Chriſt to have ſuffered, and ſo to enter into his glory. For though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> He ſaith elſewhere, —<hi>wiſt you not that I muſt go about my Fathers buſineſs. —I come not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. —It is my meat and drink to do my Fathers will.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh was in the condition of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and had not where to lay his head; though he was Heir of all things
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:49664:277"/> yet could not be ſeized on the Inheritance, till the Condition was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on his part.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Condition on Gods part was his Exaltation. —<hi>Being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8, &amp;c.</note> 
                              <hi>even the death of the Croſs; wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. —This is the mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Eph. 1.10. &amp;c.</note> 
                              <hi>when he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly places, &amp;c. —When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſate down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, being made ſo much better than the Angels, as he hath by Inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3, &amp;c.</note> 
                              <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee: And again, I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son. And again, When he bringeth in the Firſt begotten into the World, he ſaith, And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.—But unto the Son he ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a Scepter of Righteouſneſs is the Scepter of thy kingdom. Thou haſt loved righteouſneſs and hated iniquity,</hi>

                              <hi>therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thy fellows. —For to this end Chriſt both died and roſe again, that he might be Lord both of quick and dead. —The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> —<hi>All Power is given unto me both in heaven and earth, Go ye therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Before his Reſurrection Chriſt had no authority to execute, no not in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where he was born King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he was deſpiſed and rejected there; but after his Reſurrection, God gave him <hi>the Heathen for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Before, when they ſought to make him a King, he refuſed, and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. When requeſted but to divide an Inheritance, he refuſed, ſaying, <hi>Who made me a Judge or a Divider among you.</hi> Then was he ſubject to the Powers of the Earth; now a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, whoſe kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
                           <p>And although moſt Kings do not ſubmit their Powers unto him,<note place="margin">Chriſt hath all Power.</note> yet he hath power over them, and will make them ſubmit whether they will or no, when he ſhall have brought down all Rule, and all Authority and Power, and ſhall put all things in ſubjection under his feet. And this they ſhall know and feel in that day when they ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and ſhall call to the Hills to cover them, and to the Mountains to fall upon them, to hide them from the wrath of him that ſitteth upon the Throne. And when he ſhall ſay, <hi>Where are thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould rule over them, bring them hither and ſlay them before me. —Then ſhall he bruiſe them with a rod of iron, and break them in pieces like a Potters veſſel.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> 
                              <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, be ye learned ye that are Judges of the earth, kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, yea but a little; but bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus Chriſt by his Sufferings hath purchaſed Rule over all the World, but more eſpecially over his Church. A Scepter of Righteouſneſs he uſeth for his friends, a Rod of Iron for his enemies. Chriſt's moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious rule is in Heaven, therefore after his Reſurrection, his firſt work was to ſend his Ambaſſadours to preach his Kingdom to every Creature. —<hi>As
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:49664:278"/> my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you: —Whoſe ſins ye remit they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and whoſe ſins ye retain they are retained. —Whatſoever ye bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven. —He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And after his Aſcenſion he ſent down the Holy Ghoſt, with great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to work wiſdom and Miracles. —<hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In Chriſts life time upon Earth the Holy Ghoſt was not given, and the reaſon was, becauſe Chriſt was not yet glorified. This Miſſion of the Spirit being the moſt glorious adminiſtration of his Kingdom, when the great Wiſdoms and Powers of the World were not able to reſiſt the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of his Spirit by which his Diſciples ſpake. When the fooliſhneſs of God was wiſer than the wiſdom of men, and the weakneſs of God was ſtronger than the power of men.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Corol.</note>Thus Chriſt conſidered as a Mediator, is the Conditional Heir of all things under God: And ſo Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, are the Conditional Heirs of all things under Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Thus God Covenanted with Chriſt to give him a Kingdom, but he muſt get it by Conqueſt, according to the nature of a Feudal kingdom. So God Covenants with Chriſtians, to give them a kingdom with Chriſt, and under Chriſt, but they muſt get it by Conqueſt. The kingdom of Heaven muſt be preſſed into, and the violent take it by force, and no otherwiſe. The good fight of Faith muſt be fought out, before we can lay hold upon the Crown of Righteouſneſs. So the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the kingdom of <hi>Canaan</hi> given them, but they muſt fight for it before they could be put in poſſeſſion. And this is the true nature of getting and of keeping a Feudal Kingdom.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Chriſts New way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</note>Thus a New way had Chriſt of conquering, by Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. So do Chriſtians conquer, by Self denial, Love of enemies, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſuffering for Righteouſneſs ſake; outward force againſt force, and learning againſt learning, and policy againſt policy, may claſh together like rocks of equal force, and come off from each other ſafe and as ſtrong as ever; but when Weakneſs is advanced againſt Power, in the Name of God, and Simplicity and Innocence againſt Learning and deep Policy, then is the mighty Power of God diſcovered, <hi>Who ſees not as man ſees, nor judges according to outward appearance.</hi> Whoſe wayes are not like mans waies, but of another faſhion.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt is the Heir of all things, therefore God covenanted with Chriſt, as the Teſtator covenants with his Heir, to enjoy his Inheritance upon ſuch terms, as to convey part of his Eſtate to ſuch or ſuch Legates or Co-heirs.</p>
                           <p>So the Promiſe was made to Chriſt, that it might be ſure to all the Seed; for in Chriſt the Promiſes of God are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God covenanted with Chriſt, he hath alſo covenanted with his Seed. — <hi>Behold I and the Children which God hath given me. —Of thoſe whom thou haſt given me, have I loſt none, —for they are mine, and I am thine.</hi>

If a Covenant therefore be conditional with Chriſt, how can it be abſolute with Chriſtians? Thus they confound and perplex all things.</p>
                           <p>A Donative may be abſolute, a Teſtament may be abſolute, a Law or Conſtitution may be abſolute, a Promiſe may be abſolute; but a Pact or Covenant is upon ſome condition, and the non-performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, diſſolves the Pact, and brings in a penalty of forfeiture.</p>
                           <p>And ſuch a Condition there is in Gods Teſtament, namely, Faith and Repentance, which ſome make the Effect, or Means, or they know not what.</p>
                           <p>If ſo, then the main point of the Scriptures muſt be quite laid aſide, or quite expunged. Becauſe the whole Tenour of the Scriptures runs along clear contrary. —<hi>If thou believeſt thou ſhalt be ſaved. —Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>This is to have and to hold of God <hi>in Fide.</hi> So God gives his Eſtate firſt to Chriſt, to have and to hold of him in Fee. Secondly to Chriſtians, to have and to hold of Chriſt in Fee.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſhares his Sufferings with Chriſtians. —<hi>We fill up that which is behind of the Sufferings of Chriſt, for his Body's ſake, which is the Church. Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? —He that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye.—In as much as ye did it unto them, ye have done it unto me.</hi> And Chriſt is crucified in his members.</p>

                           <p>Great miſtakes about the two Covenants of God.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Law of Innocency or Works was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> to do Gods will, if not, upon the leaſt breach to die without hope of pardon upon Repentance.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Law of Grace was made with <hi>Adam</hi> to do Gods will, if not, to obtain pardon upon Faith and Repentance by Chriſt, in whom God ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf reconcileable, to deliver from death due by the law of Works. This Covenant of Grace was renewed to the Patriarchs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and the Prophets, but eſpecially manifeſted by Chriſt to all men.</p>
                           <p>The Errour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, was to hope for Juſtification by the Covenant of Works, without Faith.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt was the head Party in this Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> and all Mankind; who are or may be the ſeed of Chriſt by believing, and Chriſt by being born under the Law, anſwers the Law by fulfilling it for all his Seed, and takes away the Curſe, and brings in Bleſſedneſs by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Covenant of Grace made with all men.</note>And that this Covenant of Grace was made with all men is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe Reaſons:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Parties of a Covenant muſt needs be certainly known who they are.<note place="margin">Parties of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants muſt be certainly known.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. God is known, who promiſeth the Reward.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Mankind is known, to whom the Reward is promiſed, and who ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate with God for it.</p>
                           <p>But if the Covenant was made with ſome of Mankind only, and the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:49664:279"/> reſt excluded, it cannot be certainly known, who thoſe are that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant, and who not.</p>
                           <p>Now it is moſt contrary to the nature of a Covenant, to be ſtruck with perſons that are unknown, or not certainly known; becauſe the Parties intereſted muſt certainly know themſelves to be intereſted, and others that have the ſame intereſt, muſt certainly know their fellows that are parties with them in the ſame Covenant, becauſe all together they make but one party, and God is the other. And both theſe muſt know one another, and underſtand one another, and agree one with another, and know the Terms of their agreement, and be diſcernable from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in all Covenants, the names of the Covenantees are expreſt,<note place="margin">Appellative names in Covenants.</note> that is, either their Proper names, or elſe Common names, ſufficient to expreſs every individual by; ſo that they may as plainly be underſtood who they are, as if they were particularly named.</p>
                           <p>So in the Teſtamentary Covenant of God, all with whom God Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and that do mutually covenant with God, are expreſſed by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative name of <hi>the Faithful in Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe perſons, <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity, did not underſtand what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Chriſt their Head procured to be made for them, nor what the condition was which they were to perform, till they had a Being, and the uſe of a Rational underſtanding. But when they came to Adult age, it was revealed unto them, and they found not their proper, but their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative Names in the Bond, and thereby had a determinate knowledge, and were able to enſure themſelves and each others, that they were the true Parties that were to covenant with God, and that they were bound ſo to do, or elſe to forfeit their Bleſſing. And from their underſtanding it came to their Wills, to chooſe whether they would covenant with God or no, and that it was their own fault if they did not, becauſe the terms were indifferently offered to them all: And that if they did perform the Condition, which Chriſt their Head had undertaken to make them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to perform, they ſhould obtain the benefits purchaſed by him for them; if not, they muſt of neceſſity loſe it, and ſuffer the puniſhment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Bond.</p>
                           <p>So in the Covenants and Teſtaments of men, when there are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to covenant with one ſingle perſon, and thoſe either in preſent or future being, it is impoſſible to particularize every ſingle perſon that is now alive, or are yet for to come, nor can any Will or Covenant contain them, nor is it rational to ſet them down if they could; but it is very ſufficient to comprehend them all, that are or ſhall be the Parties, by ſome common name, as of Heirs, Executors, Adminiſtrators or Aſſigns, or of all honeſt, painful, and miſerable perſons in ſuch or ſuch a City or Country, whereby they that are ſo qualified, are undoubtedly the perſons meant by the Teſtator or Covenanter in his ſaid Will and Covenant, and may lawfully claim the Legacies or Benefits intended for them, and promiſed unto them.</p>

                           <p>If this Publick perſon break the Covenant for himſelf and by himſelf, he only is guilty for himſelf and by himſelf properly and really, as to the ſin; but improperly and <hi>quaſily,</hi> and by act of Law, his heirs or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors are guilty, that is, ſo accounted, and therefore they really ſuffer the loſs and penalty by their Fathers ſin, not enjoying the benefit which they ſhould have had, if he had not broken the Covenant for himſelf by act of Nature, nor they with him by act of Law. So that they ſuffer the ſhame and loſs by being Sons to ſuch a Father, and are ſo far tainted in their blood, and leſſened in their heads; but yet they may ſtipulate for themſelves, and be faithful, and recover the honour and eſtate, which they loſt by their Father, ſo far as in him lay.</p>
                           <p>If this Publick perſon keep the Covenant for himſelf, he is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable for himſelf properly and really, as to the virtue of his keeping it; and his heirs and ſucceſſors are not really nor properly rewardable, but <hi>quaſily</hi> and by act of Law, and therefore they are really rewarded, and enjoy the benefit only by ſuch act and conſtitution, and have the honour of being Sons to ſuch a Father, are pure in blood, and advanced in their heads.</p>
                           <p>If the heirs to thoſe Publick perſons actually break the Covenant kept by their Forefathers, they only are really guilty for themſelves, and are a ſhame to their Predeceſſors, who are no leſs honourable nor vertuous, really nor quaſily, for their degenerating Progeny.</p>

                           <p>If I ſtipulate for my ſelf, and my heirs, and they conſent and break it when they have done, they ſin actually, and ſuffer the juſt penalty for their commiſſion.</p>
                           <p>But ſtill they are not really bound to underſtand what I underſtand, nor to conſent to what I conſent, nor to do what I do, by my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but for the reaſonableneſs of the thing, and the example of their Head, who meant them honour and benefit, which they were capable of, but unthankfully refuſed. And more could not be done for them, that would do nothing for themſelves.</p>
                           <p>But if they do underſtand what I underſtand, and do conſent to what I conſent, and do what I do, if it be good, they do well, and ſhall be well rewarded; but if they do not underſtand what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor conſent to what I conſent, nor do what I do, if it be good, they do ill, and ſhall be ill rewarded.</p>
                           <p>My Goodneſs is an example and pattern for them to follow; not ſo much an obligation of mine, as of goodneſs it ſelf, and for the benefit that might redound to them thereby.</p>

                           <p>So an Heir or Succeſſor is bound to follow the good example and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his Anteceſſor, who kept his Covenant which he made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for his Succeſſors if they would for themſelves; but he is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by that Perſonal covenanting in his own Name, but by his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant, which he may or may not make in his own Name: If he make it, he is bound, if he make it not, he is free.</p>
                           <p>For the Action of bare Covenanting is not, cannot properly and truly be tranſient to Succeſſors, but immanent and lodged in themſelves. <hi>Unuſquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que habet judicium &amp; voluntatem pro ſemetipſo;</hi> Every one hath a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will for himſelf, and no body elſe.</p>
                           <p>I may fare the better for another Man's Goodneſs, but I am never the better for his Goodneſs. I may fare the worſe for another Man's Badneſs, but I am never the worſe for his Badneſs.</p>
                           <p>Another Man's keeping of Covenants is none of mine; and another Man'ss breaches of Covenants are none of mine.</p>
                           <p>If any Man will bind me by a penalty to covenant with him, I may for the penalties ſake yield for fear, and the Covenant is my own Act; but not Noble, becauſe not for love; or if I will not yield, I can but loſe, all the World cannot force me againſt my Will.</p>
                           <p>I may bind my Heir to do ſuch a thing, or elſe to forfeit his Eſtate: he may do or not do this if he will. If it be a good duty he is bound to it for Goodneſs ſake, and for the kindneſs of the Donor, not for any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation he could put upon his Will, but for the obligation, which his own Will puts upon him.</p>
                           <p>If he do it not, he ſuffers the Will of the Teſtator to be done upon him, and he muſt ſuffer it whether he will or no; not naturally, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and by Act of Law ſo ordering it.</p>
                           <p>Acts of Nature are common to all, Acts of Law to none but thoſe that have free and rational Wills, who being under a Law, are bound to obey, but may refuſe, but muſt ſuffer.</p>

                           <p n="6">6. If God decreed Juſtification and Salvation from all eternity, then what needs the dear purchaſe of Chriſt his precious Bloud? Is not this Socinianiſm, to take away the Satisfaction of Chriſt, judg all Men?</p>
                           <p n="7">7. If the Covenant of Grace be not made with all Men, then all Men are not bound to the Condition; but all Men are bound to the Condition, therefore the Covenant of Grace is made with all Men.</p>
                           <p>If there be no ground to believe for ſome, becauſe they have no hope of help, being ſhut out by inevitable Fate, and none can tell who theſe be, why ſhould all Men be bound to believe, when all Men cannot be aſſured, becauſe Chriſt died not for all Men. And though the Goſpel be preached to all Men; yet the Promiſes thereof belong to very few, and God only knows who they be; and woe be to the reſt of the World, whether they believe or no, if it were poſſible for them to believe.</p>

                           <p>Thus all Liege Lords are Patrons and Benefactors, and all Liege Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are Clients and Beneficiaries. The Devil rewards his Servants, and God rewards his Servants.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Adam</hi> was in Covenant of Works in his Innocency, but after his Fall he was in the Covenant of Grace, and entred into a Fee.</p>

                        <p>IN a Feudal kingdom there can be no place for Merit;<note place="margin">Tranſition.</note> becauſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiaries and Uſufructuaries receive all upon grace from their Lord and Benefactor, and hold what they have from him for love, honour and ſervice which they owe him for all that they have; neither can they recompenſe the Donor by all that they do, or can do for him, but muſt account themſelves unprofitable Servants when all is done.</p>
                        <p>The foundation and ſource of Merit is,<note place="margin">Foundation of Merit.</note> the performance of a work which is not due, to another, or which no Right on our part could compel us, nor the party for whoſe ſake it is done, had any right to enforce the doing of the ſame from us.</p>
                        <p>Therefore no mortal man can merit any thing at Gods hands, though it were poſſible for him to fulfil the Law of God exactly; and therefore God can be a Debtor to no man, but as he is pleaſed to make himſelf ſo by his free and gracious Promiſe, which gives him to whom the Promiſe was made, a right by Grace, which by works he could not have. —<hi>And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 11.6, 7.</note> 
                           <hi>But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace, otherwiſe Work is no more Work. —Therefore it is of Faith</hi> (or Covenant) <hi>that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 4.16.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore no mortal man can merit any thing at the hands of his Prince, though it were poſſible for him to fulfil his whole Law exactly. And therefore the Prince can be a Debtor to no Subject, but as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make himſelf ſo by his free and gracious Promiſe, which gives him to whom th Promiſe was made, a right by grace, which by works he could not have.</p>
                        <pb n="522" facs="tcp:49664:285"/>
                        <p>Yet God and Princes, who have power perfectly to oblige their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, do confer good things upon thoſe that obey their Commands, to ſtir up their readineſs to obey, not as Rewards due, but as Free gifts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon is, Becauſe thoſe things which I perfectly owe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he to whom they are due from me hath already a right unto them, ſo that if I do them, properly I part with nothing of that to which for the preſent I have a right; becauſe, if I withhold my duty; or deny it to him to whom it is due, I do him wrong, becauſe the right of that office is no longer mine, but his to whom I am obliged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I do what I ſhould do, there can be no place left for any Merit at all.</p>
                        <p>But when without any perfect obligation on my part I do what I do to another, that right which iſſues from me accrues to him, and leaves me a right to be had from him, upon whom I did beſtow as much work as did countervail the wages he gave me; and this is Merit.</p>
                        <p>If this Merit be expreſly ſtipulated for, it is called Wages, if it be left for the manner, time, quantity and quality thereof, to the free will and equity of the Donor, it is called a Reward, which is either corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, as Mony, Cattel, Fields, Houſes, Houſhold goods, &amp;c. or incorporeal, as Immunities, Priviledges, Honours, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>So that a Merit is a kind of work of Supererogation iſſuing from our own free will, more than we need to do, and of which we may glory, and for which we may expect thanks. And this being a grace to God or man, muſt of neceſſity deſtroy the grace of God or man, as if they were the better for us. When the contrary is moſt true, that we are the better for them, and ſo they merit of us in this caſe, and not we of them at all. And therefore all School Diſputes of Merits on mans part, are but idle talk.</p>
                        <p>If there were any ſuch thing as Merit in us, Then firſt we ſhould be the better for doing that good, which we were never obliged to do; and God ſhould be the better for that good, which he could never exact from us. But this is abſurd.</p>
                        <div n="1" type="section">
                           <head>SECT. I.</head>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Demerit.</note>On the contrary; a Demerit is the Non-performance of a work which is due to another, or to which a right on our part ſhould compel us, and the Party to whom it is not done, had a right to compel us to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame, but we would not do it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore all mortal men do demerit many things at Gods hands, when they are obliged to obey his Laws and do not; and therefore all men are debtors to God, and do demerit againſt him by their evil works.</p>
                           <p>Therefore all mortal men do demerit many things at the hand of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they are obliged to obey their Laws and do not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are debtors to their Prince, and do demerit againſt them by their evil works.</p>
                           <p>In all Demerits or ſins againſt another there are two things; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it ſelf, or diſtance from the Rule of the Law, according to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution or intention thereof, and the loſs accruing thereby to the Law-maker directly or indirectly. The Party therefore that demerits or ſins
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:49664:285"/> is accountable to the Lawmaker for the ſin it ſelf, or the breach of his Law, and for the loſs that accrues to him thereby. For both which he is bound to ſuffer puniſhment commenſurable to the offence of the Law, and to the loſs or damage received thereby.</p>
                           <p>And therefore every mortal man is a debtor to God to ſatisfie for his ſin againſt his Law, and for the damage (to ſpeak after the manner of men) which he received thereby, by repentance and amendment, and ſufficient caution (if it could be) to do ſo no more. Theſe things may and do hold in <hi>Foro humano,</hi> but how they can or do hold in <hi>Foro divino,</hi> I confeſs I do not underſtand. And therefore I break off this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe abruptly; what I have ſaid already is come hardly from me, and the reſt is altogether out of my reach.</p>
                           <p>Only this I think I may ſay, That Feudal Subjects can do no more than is due, and therefore cannot merit; but may do leſs than is due, and therefore do demerit.</p>
                           <p>The effect of their work in coming up to the Rule of Feudal Law, is their virtue, and the benefit (if any may be ſaid to be) to the Law-maker is their reward: But the defect of their work in coming ſhort to the rule of the Feudal Law, is their ſin, and the damage (if any may be ſaid to be) is their puniſhment.</p>
                           <p>And as every Merit ſuppoſeth a work of Supererogation, undue and uncommanded, and therefore is not imputable to any but to them that do it, for the vertue or for the reward thereof. So every Demerit ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a work of Supererogation, unrequired and unforbidden, and therefore is not imputable to any but to them that commit it, for the vice, or for the puniſhment thereof.</p>
                           <p>And therefore, as it is contrary to nature,<note place="margin">Rewards and Puniſhments.</note> for any one to be rewarded for that good deed which cannot be imputed unto him, becauſe he never did it: ſo it is contrary to nature for any one to be puniſhed for that evil deed, which cannot be imputed unto him, becauſe he never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
                           <p>For as by Rewards men are encouraged to vertue, and the reward ought to be diſtributed upon the conſideration of the good deed: ſo by Puniſhments men are deterred from vice, and the puniſhment ought to be inflicted upon the conſideration of the evil deed. And as none are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly capable of the rewards, but thoſe perſons that have done the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as the cauſe of thoſe rewards: ſo none are properly capable of the puniſhments, but thoſe perſons that have committed the ſin, as the cauſe of thoſe puniſhments.</p>
                           <p>Therefore as the pleaſure and profit of the Reward, is properly due by merit to him who acted or concurred to the good done: So the grief or diſprofit of the Puniſhment, is properly due by demerit to him who acted or concurred to the evil committed.</p>
                           <p>So Children are not properly rewarded by Merit, when their Father for his vertue is inveſted with the Fee: And Children are not properly puniſhed by Demerit, when their Father for his vice is deveſted of the Fee.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe as in that reſpect Children are not directly rewarded, with the inveſtiture of that right which was not properly their own: So neither are Children in that reſpect directly puniſhed, with the deveſtiture of that right which was not properly their own. But only by conſequence,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:49664:286"/> both, they are rewarded when they have the Fee, which their Fathers had and kept by their Allegiance to their death, for them to ſucceed after them; and they are puniſhed when they have loſt their Fee, which their Fathers loſt, and did not keep by their felony to their death, for them to loſe after them what they might have had, if their Fathers had performed the Condition.</p>
                           <p>So if Parents for their Vertue be made free, their Children ſhall be free, but this hath no true reſpect of reward, but good fortune: So if Parents for their Fine be reduced to ſlavery, their Children ſhall be ſlaves, but this hath no true reſpect of puniſhment, but evil fortune. Becauſe no body before he is, can have right that he ſhould be born in ſuch or ſuch a condition; but when he is born ſo or ſo, it is his good or bad chance. As an Infant in his Mothers womb is not properly acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when his Mother is acquitted and ſaved her life; nor properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned when his Mother is condemned, and loſeth her life.</p>

When ſuch moral Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as Scientifical of themſelves, and create as full an aſſent to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as Natural things, which are perceptible of themſelves, and create a full apprehenſion to the ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>The Laws of Nature are plain, and as plain conſequences may be made from them; As that no man ſhould ſteal, or kill, and from thence it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:49664:286"/> That if <hi>Sejus</hi> or <hi>Titius</hi> do ſteal or kill, they ſin againſt the Law of Nature.</p>
                        <p>And ſuch Ratiocinations as are rightly framed from neceſſary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, create as undeniable Demonſtrations; As that a man is Riſible,<note place="margin">Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Rational: That a Horſe is one, true and good, becauſe he is an <hi>Ens;</hi> or that the Periphery of a Circle is Equidiſtant from the Centre.</p>
                        <p>Now if the Laws of Nature be ſo plain, then they need no Judge. And if the Poſitive Laws are ſo plain, as they are or ought to be, then they need no Judge alſo.</p>
                        <p>All Intellectual Entities have hitherto, by the moſt of men been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted probable only (allowing by great favour, infallibility to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) and therefore have been the more ſlighted, and nothing thought worthy of credit, but material Entities and objects of ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>Now if Revelations come, as they may do to the underſtanding, as well as Natural notions and Senſual objects, why may they not as plainly be apprehended, ſuppoſing them, as they muſt, to be as plainly revealed, as the reſt are imprinted in the Soul, or conveyed thither by the ſenſe?</p>
                        <p>But ſtill the Queſtion is, Who ſhall be the Judg? and this Judge muſt be infallible too.</p>
                        <p>The old beaten way is, <hi>to believe as the Church believes,</hi> and the Churches Faith is reſolved into the Pope, or a general Council, with or without him, not yet agreed.</p>
                        <p>Surely there is a fallacy in the word <hi>Church,</hi> as in the word <hi>People.</hi> The Church is either taken for all the Church, and the People for all the People, which cannot meet to agree all; or for the moſt part, or beſt of the Church or People, which can hardly meet to agree all. So there is no certainty in either.</p>

                           <p>Univerſal Traditions are doubtful.<note place="margin">Traditions.</note> The Eaſtern Church had one Tradition about Eaſter from St. <hi>John;</hi> the Weſtern another from St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> the Millenaries received their Tradition from <hi>Papias,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciple; the reſt denied it.</p>
                           <p>Councils were hardly ever univerſal, or univerſally agreeing, and moſtly packt; a few popular Orators and Politicians ſwayed all the reſt. So that we are at no certainty by theſe.</p>
                           <p>Certainty is either in Nature, things actually exiſtent to ſenſe, or in Morality from prime principles undoubted concluſions in the mind, by Rational or Mathematical Demonſtrations actually exiſtent to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                           <p>The Law of Nature is plain enough, Conſequences from thence are clear, if rightly deducted by the help of Art. Laws Poſitive are to flow from thence. Subjects may know by theſe Laws, what they are to have, and what they are to do.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Scriptures.</note>The Scriptures are God's Poſitive Laws, commanded in his Will and Teſtament, with Promiſes of Rewards; ſo that by them all Subjects and Legatees underſtand what they are to have, and what they are to do. And as the Laws and Teſtaments of wiſe and good men are evident, ſo much more the Laws and Teſtaments of God.</p>
                           <p>And therefore in all theſe Laws there is ſufficient Certainty to every one, who when all comes to all, muſt judge as well as they can for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Laws fundamental and neceſſary are ſo plain, that they may judge. Elſe why ſhould thoſe Promiſes be made, and thoſe Duties be commanded, if they to whom they were made and enjoyned could not poſſibly apprehend them; and what other infallible Judge can be imagined? eſpecially when, beſides their own Judgments, the Spirit is promiſed to all that will uſe what God hath already given them, to lead them into all truth. And ſo Chriſt, the only Infallible Judge, hath promiſed to be preſent by his Spirit unto the end of the World.</p>
                           <p>If in this ſtate of Imperfection there remain doubts, as there will, we muſt be content to doubt as we do about ſuch manners and circumſtances of things as are not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, the ignorance whereof may ſafely conſiſt with our ſalvation. If others be given over to believe lies, it is a juſt Judgment of God upon them for their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and ſenſuality. As is the caſe of the Heathen Idolaters, <hi>who though they knew God, yet they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh hearts were darkened.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But ſtill, Wiſdom is juſtified of all her Children, and the true Faith hath been kept by them, and will be kept unto the end of the World, and Truth is Truth ſtill.</p>
                           <p>In natural Principles all conceptions agree; as to worſhip God, to do as we would be done by, &amp;c. and in ſupernatural Principles there is the ſame harmony of Faith in God and a good life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                           <p>Thus the whole Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> all Chriſtians in all ages have received the Goſpel, and kept the Faith, and ſo the Church is the pillar and ground of Truth.</p>
                           <p>The Church of God is guided by the Scriptures, and by the Spirit of God in them. If there be other Traditions without writing, they alſo for the main agree with the Traditions written, but ſome circumſtances may differ, and ſome muſt needs be loſt in both. But ſtill the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Writing muſt needs be the ſureſt and moſt laſting; wherefore God himſelf wrote the two Tables with his own hand, and commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to write the reſt for a perpetual Record.</p>
                           <p>As for Traditions without writing, they muſt needs be more hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, becauſe of the ſhortneſs of mens lives, the weakneſs and varieties of mens apprehenſions and memories, the Intereſt of parties, &amp;c. Nor are Writings impregnable, but in the changes of times, if they eſcape the fire, and other ruines, they cannot eſcape the ignorance and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Scribes: But God hath hitherto, among both Jews and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſecured the main Oracles written and unwritten, and will ſecure them for ever.</p>

                           <p>As for an exact Repreſentation of the holy Catholick Church it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be imagined, either in the Head thereof, which is Chriſt,<note place="margin">Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church.</note> there being no expreſs warrant for ſuch a Repreſentative Head, or in the Members for ſuch a Repreſentative Body. For who can repreſent the mind of Chriſt, but the Spirit of Chriſt which is in him? or who can repreſent the mind of Chriſtians, but the Spirit of Chriſtians which is in them.</p>
                           <p>For Chriſt will not, needs not, come in Perſon to declare his will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſufficiently done it already, and Chriſtians cannot meet all together to declare their will; becauſe there are moſt in Heaven, from whence it is impoſſible for them to come, and the reſt are in all parts of the World, from whence it is little leſs than impoſſible they ſhould gather together; and if they ſhould, they would all agree moſt certainly in the ſame Faith and Holineſs, but in Forms and Circumſtances they could not.</p>
                           <p>And beſides, there would be Hypocrites among them, do what they can; for all that Profeſs have not faith. And moreover, men as men, have various conceptions, apprehenſions and reaſonings, and languages, and humors, and intereſts. And words are too few for things, and are ambiguous, and Idioms are diverſe, and there will be miſtakes, and there is no help for it, and few have the true Arts of right reaſoning; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe caſes, they muſt be contented to bear one with another, and keep the peace well enough.</p>
                           <p>We may thank God that he hath left us the Scriptures, and they are ſufficient for ſalvation, and be contented, and judge as well as we can.</p>
                           <p>So men are fain to do in Civil Laws, with ſome helps of Judges, becauſe mens Laws are not ſo plain as they ſhould be, but Gods are, and they muſt reſt ſatisfied with what they know, till God ſhall come in into them, by farther diſcoveries upon their honeſt ſearch and endeavours after ſaving truth.</p>
                           <p>But ſtill where ſcruples are, ſome body muſt determine,<note place="margin">Some body muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note> becauſe of practice and becauſe of peace, I mean in matters of Diſcipline, and ſo people muſt be contented, though not ſatisfied; but in Faith and a good Conſcience, every one knows ſufficiently, and every one is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                           <p>So in a Ship, the Pilot muſt ſteer as well as he can, though he may fail, and ſome body elſe may know better. For every one hath liberty to judge for himſelf; but not altogether to act for himſelf, much leſs for others. That's left to Governours, who are as Gods, yet they may erre as men (it being Gods Prerogative only to know all good and evil,) and yet under God we muſt be guided by them, who with reverence and godly fear do determine hard caſes, as the Turkiſh <hi>Mufti,</hi> who, when conſulted to give his Judgment, ſets it down in writing, and ſubſcribes modeſtly, <hi>This is my Judgment, but God knows better.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And now what would the World have, or what can they have more than they have? and why will they not be contented with what they have, and God thinks fit for them to have? Why call they for a Judg, when God
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:49664:288"/> is their Judge? as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> called for a King, when God was their King. This is to reject the Judgment and Government of God, and truſt to the judgment and government of Men, and to have greater aſſurance than God thinks fit to allow them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Pride.</note>There is an itch of Power in all this in the Clergy, that are forbidden by their Maſter to ſeek after Greatneſs, and leave the care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church and Commonwealth to Kings and Princes, to whom it is committed, to be Nurſing Fathers and Nurſing Mothers of Gods People. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers.</hi> Let them give their Advice to Kings humbly, and teach their People truly, and give them good Examples, and they have done their duty.

                           <p>But ſtill the noiſe of an Earthly Judg rings in mine ears, and I cannot be quiet for it: And the ſound thereof takes with the Vulgar, and they are too willing to be cheated, and ſome body thereby gets no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                           <p>O good God, when ſhall we be at peace! A Faction, a ſtream of Worldly-mindedneſs and glory runs high.

                           <p>We underſtand matters of Fact to be evident to all that have their ſenſes rightly diſpoſed and exerciſed upon them, and are really infallible, as to ſenſe.</p>
                           <p>We underſtand matters of Right to be open to all Underſtandings that are rightly diſpoſed and exerciſed upon them, and are really infallible as to Reaſon.</p>
                           <pb n="529" facs="tcp:49664:288"/>
                           <p>We underſtand matters of Poſitive Law, concerning Rights grounded upon Nature's Law, to be clear to all Judgments that are rightly diſpoſed and exerciſed upon them, and are jurally infallible as to Juſtice.</p>
                           <p>The Judg judges of theſe Rights or Wrongs, according to the ſenſe of the Law as it ſtands before him, and according to the Scope, Analogy, and Proportion of the whole Law, as it is apprehended and digeſted by him, and this is adjudged to be Law by wiſe Reſpondents.</p>
                           <p>Thus he does <hi>Jus dicere,</hi> declares what is right according to Law, as well as he can, which it may be is not right in it ſelf; but it muſt be taken for right, till it appear to be wrong, leſt we ſhould run in <hi>infinitum,</hi> and never determine at all. For, <hi>Praetor Jus dicit etiamſi iniquum dixerit.</hi> And if the Supreme Power confirms it, there is no appeal but to God, we muſt reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                           <p>And this is all that can be done by Men, when all is done: And this Subjects muſt ſtand to as to their practiſe, (not as to their judgments alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) ſo long as they are not plainly and diametrically, againſt Faith and a good Life, concerning which the Scriptures give us the beſt account.</p>
                           <p>Now, though Men may preſume to judg of the mind of the Laws of Men, becauſe they make them themſelves, and ſo do know their own meanings: Yet what Man or Society of Men dare preſume to judg of the mind of the Laws of God, who is his own Law-maker, and ſo does know his own meaning?</p>
                           <p>But God will reveal his Mind and Will to thoſe that humbly ſeek to him for it, and ſo they ſhall judg for themſelves, according to the judgments which God hath given them in Nature, and upon their right uſing of the ſame, according to what he ſhall further illuminate them by Grace.</p>
                           <p>But who ſhall preſume uncontrollably to judg for others, by impoſing his Sentiments upon them, though they may in the mean time command his outward Man; yet I cannot tell how they can command his inward Mind and Will, for that it muſt be beſt at laſt to leave every Man to God and his own Conſcience, ſtill keeping obedience and peace, both in Church and State.</p>

                           <p>From ſuch a corrupt Aſſembly, perſevering in her corruptions, although the Faithful may and muſt ſeparate themſelves; yet the ſeparation is not ordinate, when ſome one ſingle Perſon ſeparates from all the reſt, or a few from many, or a leſſer number from the greater number; eſpecially if that one, few, or leſſer number have liberty to live according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, and according to the ſafety of their conſciences, and withall there is no Chriſtian Aſſembly more pure, to whom they may conveniently adjoin themſelves.</p>

                           <p>Yet in this wiſh of the Apoſtle, this muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed, that he wiſhed not poſitively the execution of it, unleſs thoſe perſons continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible. For, who can poſſibly doubt, but that S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>velle</hi> went with a <hi>malle,</hi> to have them rather reform'd than deſtroy'd. And again, if they
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:49664:291"/> would not be reform'd, who ſees not but that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might lawfully wiſh that ſome few turbulent deceivers ſhould rather be cut off by the hand of God, than that by them the whole Church of the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſhould be ſeduced, and their ſtate of Chriſtian Liberty ſubverted.</p>
                           <p>This fact of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in wiſhing the death of theſe impoſtors, muſt not by us be drawn into example, as if to us it were therefore lawful to wiſh a curſe upon thoſe whom we account Hereticks and troublers of the Church.</p>
                           <p>For, 1. Chriſt hath given us a precept to the contrary, That we ſhould bleſs and not curſe; yea, bleſs them that curſe us, and pray for them that perſecute us.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44.</note> And our Rule is to practiſe by precept, and not by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from Men, or an Angel from heaven.</p>
                           <p>Unleſs the precept admit exceptions, and the caſes of thoſe exceptions be as manifeſt to us as to thoſe Divine Perſons, who made uſe of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the generality of the Precept.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Where among us ſhall we find the Man in whom there reſides that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wiſdom which was in <hi>Paul,</hi> who by help of the Spirit wherewith he abounded, was a true diſcerner of Spirits, and could exactly know who was a ſpreader of Error, who a troubler of the Church, who was refractory herein, and whoſe repentance was either to be expected, or to be deſpair'd?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Where among us is the Man whoſe Soul is qualified with the affection of <hi>Paul,</hi> to be led to the like wiſh with the like mind? For without all doubt, all the motive <hi>Paul</hi> had, was a ſincere zeal to God's glory, and a true love to Man's Salvation: But we in the like caſe, what ever words we may pretend, can hardly ſay, We have purged our Souls from the leven of malice and hatred.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Paul,</hi> as we have ſeen, wiſhed not their death ſimply and abſolutely, but with a potiority of their repentance, that they might rather be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and therefore he referres the iſſue wholly to the pleaſure of God, leaving his wiſh to depend on God's will.</p>
                           <p>If it be therefore unlawful it be to wiſh the death of one, whom we call <hi>Heretick,</hi> in that meaning we put upon it, much leſs is it lawful to put him to death. Nay this latter is unlawful, though the former were ſuppoſed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: For he that wiſheth another Man's death, doth commit the act ot the will of God, as it ſhall ſtand with the pleaſure of God, that he live or die; but he that attempts another's death by Mans hand, hath already determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what is to be done, without any farther diſcuſs of the matter. And it is lawful to wiſh many a thing were done, which notwithſtanding to do we have no lawful Power.</p>
                           <p>Although then to <hi>Paul</hi> it were lawful to wiſh the death of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> yet it follows not therefore that it is lawful for the Magiſtrate to put them to death. For, hath God granted to the Magiſtrate power over the conſcience, or given him the Sword with ſuch a large commiſſion, that thereby he muſt needs be armed, not only againſt offending <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but alſo againſt all true and innocent Chriſtians, which equally lye open to the ſtroke of his ſword; ſeeing the leſs Chriſtian any Man is, the more prone he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn another for an heretick; and the more carnal he is, the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent he grows to maintain an humane tradition againſt a Divine Verity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this latter ſuiteth leſs with his carnal waies, and many Men in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity do not embrace the ſincerity of Religion, but uſe it rather as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for their worldly policy.</p>
                           <p>Or, hath God given to the Magiſtrate the Judgment of the conſcience, or
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:49664:291"/> the diſcerning of Spirits to determine truly between the true and the falſe? Seeing Men of Rule and power, whoſe entrance into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a thing of great difficulty, and who are commonly imploy'd in other affairs than the care of Religion, are not alwaies competent Judges in theſe caſes, eſpecially ſeeing many ſuch Perſons are not ſtudied in the caſes of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> neither are their caſes laid out by any Law either of God or Man.</p>
                           <p>How then can the Magiſtrate judge of that wherein by his calling he hath no judgment? And for him to commit a matter of that moment to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of another, is hard adventure, ſeeing he can with no ſafety exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſentence, but alwaies with danger of being the Miniſter unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's cruelty, in following whoſe judgment he relies alſo upon his own judgment, whereby he gave him power to judg of the <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But where will the Magiſtrate find competent Judges? For though many may be free from others errors, yet in matters to ſalvation neceſſary, or not neceſſary, few know accurately how to diſtinguiſh, which in this caſe is requiſite ſhould be known. Otherwiſe if you believe more things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation than really are, you will judg him an <hi>Heretick,</hi> who really is not; for you will charge him with error in that point, which you er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly think neceſſary to ſalvation: Whence it muſt needs follow, if you think it the Magiſtrate's Office to put <hi>Hereticks</hi> to death, that you in your judgment muſt firſt ſentence this or that <hi>Heretick</hi> worthy to die. But how eaſily and frequently may it fall out touching your Sentence in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that you ſhould rather be in the error than the party you condemn? For of Chriſtians that can come into queſtion of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> very few there are who are ignorant of the points ſufficient to ſalvation, much leſs of thoſe that are neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>The caſe is otherwiſe in other crimes, which common reaſon conſtantly condemns, which the conſcience of the offender condemns in himſelf, and which the Magiſtrate (though himſelf may be ſecretly guilty of them) is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Law to condemn in others, or at leaſt cannot excuſe them; being willfully committed againſt ſome poſitive Law of Man, which commanding nothing naturally diſhoneſt, the offender with a ſafe conſcience might and ought to have obſerved.</p>
                           <p>Of theſe crimes therefore, whoſe caſes are clearly laid out by poſitive Law, which particularly deſign, what act is Treaſon, what Murder, and what is Felony, the Magiſtrate can and may rightly Judg, though himſelf be not altogether free from the crime which he judgeth: But errors whoſe caſes are by no Law ſpecified, how can he rightly judg, who is himſelf in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? For in points of Religion, even to moſt Men, error is commonly more pleaſing than the Truth; which, being for the moſt part ſimple, and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, finds few patrons to defend it; but many and mighty enemies to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, who account it a ſervice unto God, to ſerve againſt the Truth.</p>
                           <p>For the Profeſſors of the Truth of Chriſt, even from the beginning of that Profeſſion, have ſuffer'd grievous perſecutions from the hands of them who when they killed them, did think they did God ſervice,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2.</note> as Chriſt tells his Diſciples. And the ſame Maſter of the Truth teſtifies elſewhere, that the Croſſe and perſecution ſhould alwaies follow his followers, after the Example of their Leader. But what greater iniquity can there be, than to vex a Man for his Conſcience ſake? For by their Conſcience, and a full perſuaſion of the Truth, moſt of thoſe Men muſt needs be led, who are content to expend their Life upon their Profeſſion: What greater folly than to force the Faith of Men
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:49664:292"/> by external violence, and to perſwade the Soul by means of the Sword? What greater inhumanity, than by torments or vexations to compel a man to that diſſembling or lying, which his Soul abhors as impious and blaſphemous? What greater indignity, than either to murther the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Truth, or to allow Hereticks the glory of Martyrdom? and to arm their Errours with an Argument ſo powerful, that the Truth in theſe times cannot find a greater, whereby to commend it ſelf to the Soul? What greater Antichriſtianity, than under colour of the Cauſe of Chriſt to perſecute the poor Members of Chriſt? For if the Cauſe of Chriſt needs blood to ſupport it, it is rather ſtrengthned by the blood of thoſe that profeſs the Truth, than of them that ſeem to oppoſe it.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, What greater impudence, than for us to condemn perſecution in the Jew and the Heathen, in the Turk and Papiſt, and our ſelves pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the ſame Perſecution which in others we condemn? Is not this, either to juſtifie all Perſecution, or to condemn our ſelves in excuſably for it?<note place="margin">Ro. 2.1.</note>

                           <p>To a Jew, who alledgeth his Law againſt Idolaters, the Anſwer may be, Let the Jewiſh Magiſtrate execute that Law according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, againſt ſuch Idolaters as are under his juriſdiction: But if by a Chriſtian, to whom the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is expired, that Law be alledged againſt Hereticks, the Allegation is not worth anſwering.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Math. 13.30.</note> and thereupon alſo forbad his Servants from medling with the Tares till the time of harveſt.

                           <p>Seeing then that the being of the Tares is a thing of neceſſity, for there muſt be Hereſies amongſt us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.13.</note>

But turbulent minds will raiſe Sedition upon any occaſion, whether of errour or truth, but moſt commonly upon occaſion of truth, and then charge the truth as the cauſe of the Sedition, which themſelves cauſed.

                           <p n="3">3. The Elector is Man, actively chooſing God, as God hath choſen him.

One with God, as God is one with him; having communion with God, as God hath communion with him. The Soul taketh God, as God takes the Soul.

So God and Man are of one Spirit: So God dwells with us, and we with him: So we have fellowſhip with the Father, and with the Son: So we love God, becauſe he loveth us. And becauſe we cannot reach to the height of his love, we ſtrain till we cry out, <hi>Stay us with Flagons, and comfort us with Apples, for</hi> we <hi>are ſick of love;</hi> and this is (without cavilling) cloſing with God, and twiſting our love in his love, as far as the poor Creatures capacity will bear.

                           <p>This Calling and Election of God is ſure on God's part, and we are to give diligence to make it ſure on our part: By continuing to hear, and bowing down our ear to receive more inſtruction. By frequenting the doors of Wiſdom, and wearing the threſhold of Underſtanding, that we may know more, and be wiſe to ſalvation. By conſenting yet more, and chooſing ſtill that good part that ſhall never be taken away from us.

                           <p>Thus they that have given their Faith to God,<note place="margin">Faithful are Elect.</note> as God hath given his Faith to them; and they that have kept their Faith to God, as God hath kept his Faith to them, they are the called and choſen of God. God is their God, and they are Gods People; they are faithful in their Promiſe, as God is faithful in his Promiſe.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe the cauſe of Bleſſedneſs is Gods Promiſe, <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                              </label> and <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> there is not, nor can be any other Cor-relative, or Cor-reſpondent to a a Promiſe, but Faith, and without Faith a Promiſe is of no effect.</p>
                           <p>The perſons therefore Called, nominated, or elected to Bleſſedneſs, are all, and only the Faithful; and the very nature of a Promiſe, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and taken, doth nominate and elect them.</p>
                           <p>For if the Acception of a Promiſe be Faith, as it is, then the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptants are the Faithful, and thereby muſt needs be nominated or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the thing promiſed: And if they ſo continue, muſt needs be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the thing promiſed.</p>
                           <p>For this I take for an infallible Principle, and Demonſtration unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, That, <hi>If the things to be done are done, then the things to be had are had; but if the things to be done are not done, then the things to be had are not had.</hi> So if Faith and Obedience, which are the things to be done on our part, are done, then Grace and Glory, which are to be had, are had on Gods part; but if the things to be done, which are Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, are not done on our part, then the things to be had, which are Grace and Glory, are not to be had on Gods part. Therefore the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Elect are all one, or rather, two terms for one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And conſequently, no perſon not faithful, of any Nation ſhall be bleſſed; but all perſons that are faithful of all Nations ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
                           <p>If therefore the Queſtion concerning Univerſal Grace were fitted to the proper Subject, the Faithful, and ſtated thus; Whether God would have all the Faithful to be ſaved or bleſſed? the matter would ſoon be at an end.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> 
                              <label type="milestone">

                              </label> there is or can be no other right reckoned or accounted to a Promiſe but by Faith. For <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, <hi>i. e.</hi> accepted his Promiſe, and this his acceptation, or faith, was accounted to him for righteouſneſs. For the Promiſe offers Right, and the Receiver takes it, and it is his own, and he is thereby juſtified to the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Faith creates a Right, or a Right paſſes by or through Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Promiſe is of no effect.</p>
                           <p>Now for this great point of Faith,<note place="margin">Faith.</note> it hath been largely handled in the Book of Juſtification. But here, for the explaining the point of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction now in hand, I ſhall declare briefly the ſeveral notions of Faith, which are theſe:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. A Belief or Credence to the truth of a thing, revealed from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God or man, is Faith, which we call hiſtorical, as to matter of Fact.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. A Confidence or Truſt in the Party that promiſeth, upon the high eſteem which we have of his honeſty and ability to perform, is Faith, which we call <hi>Fiducia,</hi> eſtimatory Faith.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="542" facs="tcp:49664:294"/>3. A Promiſe made and eſtabliſhed, and offered to another party freely, is Faith, which we call <hi>Fides data,</hi> Faith given.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. An acceptance or embracing of a Promiſe ſo made, eſtabliſhed and given freely, is Faith, which we call <hi>Fides accepta,</hi> Faith taken; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory Faith.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. A Re-promiſe, or returning of another Promiſe to the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer, is Faith, which we call <hi>Fides reddita,</hi> Faith returned.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. A Covenant or Agreement made up of theſe two Promiſes, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of wills of both parties, is Faith, which we call <hi>Fides mutua,</hi> Faith reciprocal. <hi>Fides data, fides accepta, fides reddita, fides ſervata.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. A Promiſe kept by both parties, is Faith, which we call <hi>Fidelitas,</hi> Faithfulneſs-</p>
                           <p n="8">8. A Spiritual ſight of Inviſible things, <hi>or the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> is Faith, which we call Evidence.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. A Spiritual preſence of things future, is Faith, which we call Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is rational to believe the things of God upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, that hath revealed them and teſtified them by the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles, by whom he hath revealed them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is as rational to repoſe full truſt and confidence in the Moſt high God, who is truth it ſelf, that hath revealed his Promiſe, and is both able and faithful to perform them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is rational for the Promiſer to offer and give his Faith freely.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is rational for the Party promiſed, to receive and take the Promiſe ſo freely offered and given him.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Becauſe it is rational for the party Promiſed to re-promiſe to the Promiſer.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is rational, that mutual Promiſes or Agreements of wills of both parties, do make up a Covenant compleat between them.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Becauſe it is rational, that a Promiſe mutually made and performed by both parties, is a demonſtration of their mutual faithfulneſs and love.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Becauſe by the Spiritual ſight of inviſible things, is the ſure foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of a divine Faith,</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Becauſe the Spiritual preſence of future things ſo far off, is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſurance of a divine Faith.</p>
                           <p>And therefore to walk by Faith after this manner, is to walk highly, above fleſh and blood, and contrary to fleſh and blood; above our ſenſes, by our underſtandings and reaſons; a walking out of the body in the Spirit, out of the world, and in the world to come. So as did thoſe Worthies of old.<note place="margin">Worthies of old. Heb. 11.</note> 
                              <hi>Noah,</hi> that foreſaw the flood, and prepared an Ark for it by <hi>faith.

<pb n="541" facs="tcp:49664:294"/> God.</hi> He ſought another, a better Country, even a Heavenly, and had no mind to return from whence he came, as he might have done. The ſame <hi>Abraham</hi> offered up his only hopes, <hi>Iſaak,</hi> by which his faith was tried to the purpoſe. So <hi>Sarah</hi> received ſtrength ſupernatural to conceive ſeed, when paſt Age, as was <hi>Abraham,</hi> and both as good as dead, yet from them, ſuch as they were, <hi>ſprang ſo many as the Stars of the skie for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and as the ſand which is by the Sea-ſhoar innumerable.</hi> So <hi>Iſaak</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, by faith preferring the younger before the elder,</hi> as were the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before the <hi>Jews</hi> long after this great Type. So <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Sons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> preferring typically alſo <hi>Ephraim</hi> before <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſeh.</hi> So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by the great faith he had in Gods Promiſe, gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment concerning his Bones to be buried in the Land of Promiſe. So <hi>Moſes</hi> Parents hid their proper Child for future hopes of divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and feared not the cruelty of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> So the ſame <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the ſame faith in that God that had ſo miraculouſly ſaved him, when he came to years fit for honour in <hi>Egypt,</hi> refuſed to be called, as he had right by Adoption, the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter.

The ſame faith ſaved <hi>Gideon, Barak, Samſon, Jephthah, David, Samuel,</hi> and all the Prophets and other holy men of God, <hi>who through faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouth of Lions, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to ſlight the armies of the Aliens, women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their dead raiſed to life again, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection. And others had trial of cruel mockings and ſcourgings, yea moreover of bands and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword; they wandred about in ſheep skins and in goat skins, being deſtituted, afflicted and tormented, of whom the world was not worthy; they wandred in deſerts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And all theſe having obtained a good report through faith, received not the Promiſe, God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> For the ſame Promiſes were made more lively to us, and expect a more lively faith from us, and they came in by acceſſion to the ſame Promiſes, and are made perfect by them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with us, in one Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for the ſame bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalvation through him, to whom be all praiſe and glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <p>Seeing therefore, as hath been demonſtrated, the Faithful are the Elect people of God, and in Covenant with him, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the Unfaithful are the Reprobated of God, and out of Covenant with him. For as it is plain that the Elect are the peculiar and choice Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; becauſe God hath propounded the Right to be choſen by them, and they have choſen that Right, and are approved of God for chooſing that Right: So it is as plain, that the Reprobate are the ſtrange and Refuſe people, becauſe God hath propounded the Right to be choſen by them, and they have refuſed that Right and choſen the wrong, and are diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and condemned of God for chooſing the wrong. By Faith men are elected or intituled to a Promiſe of ſalvation: By Infidelity men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from a Promiſe to damnation.</p>

What is the matter! Is it the Will of God, the Law of God, the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and muſt it not be known? Are not all Laws proclaimed, and Teſtaments opened? And are they not made (when wiſely made) ſo plain that all that are concerned might underſtand them? or elſe how ſhall they know what is commanded them, and conferred upon them, that they might perform that obedience and gratitude which is due from them, to ſuch their Rulers and Benefactors? The Learned uſe to ſay, <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari debet.</hi> That which concerns all, is to be underſtood by all. Does not the good Will and Word of God concern all? Is it only to be ſpoken to the Learned and Nobles, in ſuch languages and phraſes which they only underſtand? Are we ſent to preach only to ſuch as they that are in high places of employment in Church and State, and not as well to the poor Watchmen that ſit on the Wall; that they might hear the Will of God, and underſtand it as well as others? Surely God is no reſpecter of perſons, but we may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his mind and will is, to <hi>have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> and <hi>that in all Nations, he that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of him.</hi>

                        <p>Contracts are either Real, by which men communicate or convey their Eſtates and Patrimonies one to another; or Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by which their very Perſons are as it were communicated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed one to another.</p>
                        <p>Of this nature are Feudal, Perſonal Contracts and Leagues,<note place="margin">Contracts Real and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</note> where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons covenant to be true and juſt, and loving one to another, as if they were of one Soul, both in rule and ſubjection, betwixt King and People, and in fellowſhip and communion of the Head with the Members, and of the Members one with another, unto which are ſubordinate, real, feudal Contracts and Conveyances, of giving and receiving, of holding and

                        <p>Perſonal Contracts of this nature are the higheſt endearments and ſtricteſt obligations of love, friendſhip and unity that can be imagined, becauſe they are the unions of Souls, which muſt be more than of Bodies or Eſtates; becauſe they are Covenants for pure love, not for honours or profits, or pleaſures of goods. Becauſe to give our Eſtates and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours is a great grace; but to give our ſelves, our Souls and Bodies one to another, is the greateſt grace that can be given. Such are the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Leagues between friends and their Allies; and ſuch is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Marriage, which is for communion of Soul and Body in all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual things; ſuch are not the <hi>Quaſi</hi>-perſonal Contracts of Tutor and Pupil, Curator and Minor, &amp;c.</p>

Subjects are ſo by election to their Kings, and Children are ſo by generation to their Parents. The one muſt be rightly choſen, the other rightly begotten. The one may be disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized and loſe their right of Tenure, the other may be diſinherited, and loſe their right of ſucceſſion.</p>
                           <p>By Marriage is not only the generation of the World, in the kingdoms of Men, but the Regeneration of the Church, in the kingdom of God.

The Devil therefore is, and ever hath been, and ever will be a very great enemy to Marriage, becauſe that tends to a lawful generation towards a holy Seed to increaſe the kingdom of God; but the contrary tends to an unlawful brood, towards a prophane Seed to increaſe the kingdom of the Devil. The Devil is the Father of ill begotten Children of Lies, God is the Father of right begotten Children of Truth.

And the Clergy eſpecially were willing to comply with the Conquerors, whoſe Laws did not allow this practice. And at ſuch a troubleſom time as that was, they judged it expedient to prevent inceſtuous Marriages of brothers and ſiſter, to make this Bar or <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> of forbidding Couſins german to marry, though it were never forbidden before.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Prohibitions of Popes began at firſt with the firſt degree of Couſins, called German, then they crept farther to the ſecond degree, then to the third and fourth degrees of Couſins ſo often removed, then they came to ſeven degrees at laſt, and then back to ſix and four again, as in the <hi>Caballian</hi> Synod. Sometimes they went out of ſight; <hi>Uſque dum generatio agnoſcitur, aut memoria retinetur.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Their Reaſons are like their Laws, bald enough. For four degrees the reaſons are, becauſe there are but four Humors in the body, but four Elements in the World, and but four fingers and a thumb upon a mans hand: So the Thumb is the <hi>Stirps</hi> or Common parent. And the life of Man is but a ſpan long, and there are but four Quarters of the World. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c. Quod erat demonſtrandum!</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For ſeven degrees their Reaſons are, becauſe there are but three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, which being joyned to the four Humors of the body make ſeven, and therefore we muſt abſtain to the ſeventh Generation, that is, to Couſins ſeven times removed. Oh rare!</p>
                           <p>Alſo, becauſe by the Civil Law Inheritances deſcended but to the ſeventh degree, therefore marriages of Couſins muſt be forbid to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth degree. A falſe ground this is, if good, that they go upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Inheritances deſcend unto the tenth degree. But if not, they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon their degrees otherwiſe than the Civil Law doth, and conſequently forbid marriages of Couſins to the fifth degree excluſively, becauſe by them thoſe Couſins are reckoned but in the ſecond degree, which by the Civil Law are in the fourth degree. For by that Law there are ſo many degrees as there are perſons, one excepted, which is the Common ſtock: But by the Canon Law, ſo far as either of the perſons is diſtant from the common Parent, ſo far he is diſtant from the other in the Equal line.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, it is evident, That ſometimes that which is lawful hath been prohibited, leſt men ſhould run into that which is unlawful. Not to come too near the hedge, leaſt they ſhould get over the hedge. And this is matter of prudence and caution only, not of what is lawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>

                              </label> Now the Reaſon why in the Side line, the Computation proceedeth not directly from me to my ſiſter, but fetcheth a compaſs about upwards and downwards, and paſſeth through our Parents, is, becauſe the Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity between me and my ſiſter, is not immediate, proximous, and prime in their firſt degree, but mediate, propinquous and ſecondary, through and by the means of two common Parents.</p>
                           <p>For no Blood is derived or paſſed from me to my ſiſter, nor from her to me; <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                              </label> but Blood is derived or paſſed from our Parents to each of us, and in us their blood is parted.</p>
                           <p>My Mother therefore, who derives her blood to me immediately, muſt needs be more Conſanguineous, or nearer of kin to me than my ſiſter, who derives no blood at all to me, but only takes part of the ſame blood with me. And my Daughter, who derives her blood immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from me, muſt needs be more Conſanguineous, or nearer of kin to me than my ſiſter, who derives no blood at all from me, but only takes part of the ſame blood with me.</p>
                           <p>My Mother therefore upwards, and my Daughter downwards, are the Females of neareſt Conſanguinity or kindred to me: and therefore they make the firſt degree, for that which in order is the neareſt or next to me, muſt needs be the firſt from me: And conſequently, my Siſter being not ſo near to me in conſanguinity, kindred or blood, as is my Mother and
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:49664:303"/> Daughter, cannot be computed in the firſt degree; and therefore muſt either be in the ſecond degree, or in a degree more remote, or elſe in no degree at all.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is, that in many accurate Pedigrees, the Lines are drawn and viſibly expreſſed in the Right line or linage only; and they are drawn downwards only, according to the deſcent from the Parents to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe the courſe of the blood, which makes Conſanguinity, <label type="milestone">

                              </label> paſſeth only by deſcent downwards; but Sideward, in the Side-line or linage, no lines at all are viſibly drawn and expreſſed, becauſe the blood hath no paſſage at all that way; for there was none at all, neither from the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Siſter, nor from her to him. So that they partake not of one anothers blood, but both partake alike of their Parents blood, which deſcends in common to them both, and in them is parted into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral channels, making ſeveral deſcents: Yet for computation ſake, there are lines conveyed ſideward in the ſide-line or linage, not lines real and viſible, but only imaginative and putative, ſuch as Aſtronomers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be in Heaven, and Geographers on Earth, calling them Meridians or Parallels, which are no realities viſible or ſenſible, but only imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or fictions in Aſtronomy or Geography.</p>

And the brother and ſiſter of my father and mother, is my Uncle and Aunt.</p>
                           <p>And for my Nephew and Neece, the computation is thus; From me to my father or mother upward, is one degree; then from my father and mother downward to their ſon and daughter (which is ſideward to me) which are my brother and ſiſter, is two degrees; and from my brother and ſiſter downwards again to their ſon and daughter, is three degrees.

                           <p>This computation of degrees is according to the Civil Law, whoſe Rule is this, <hi>Tot ſunt gradus Cognationis, quot ſunt Generationes,</hi> i. e. So many Generations, ſo many Degrees.</p>
                           <p>The computation of the Canon Law is, <hi>Quoto gradu unuſquiſque eorum diſtat à communi ſtipite, eodem gradu diſtant inter ſe,</hi> i. e. In what degrees the parties are diſtant from the Common ſtock, in the ſame degree they are diſtant between themſelves. So that brothers and ſiſters Children, that by the computation of the Civil Law differ four degrees from each other, by the Canon Law differ but two degrees from each other.</p>
                           <p>So that the Civil Law conſidereth degrees, eſpecially for Succeſſions of Inheritances from perſon to perſon, numbring the degrees according to ſingle perſons, only by one degree at once, according to the next or neareſt common Stock or Parent, and thence deſcending to the perſon whoſe degree is required; but the Canon Law conſidereth rather the degrees of Marriage made by the conſent of two perſons, and for that reaſon joyneth two perſons together in the numbring of degrees.</p>
                           <p>As to Couſins german therefore (to conclude) though ſome Divines and ſome Lawyers here in <hi>England</hi> do ſcruple at the lawfulneſs of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, yet they ſcruple it without alledging any ſound reaſon, but rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only upon Tradition, and the long practice of the Canoniſts, who have forbidden thoſe marriages for meer lucre, to gain mony for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing of them by Diſpenſations, which are denied to none, but are granted of courſe for mony to all that deſire them. But from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo, neither ought it to be ſo, becauſe the Rule holds good, <hi>Quod ab initio non valuit, illud tractû temporis convaleſcere non poteſt.</hi> That which was invalid from the beginning, cannot be made valid by length of time.</p>

                           </label> The Reaſon is, becauſe in all theſe caſes, the party married is a Parent or a Child by marriage to the party marrying; that is, the woman is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Mother in law, or a Daughter in law to the man.

                           </label> the woman is ſtill either Aunt or Neece in law to the man by marriage, and ſo <hi>vice verſâ:</hi> or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties married are Uncle or Aunt, or Nephew or Neece in law, as in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity they are Uncles, Nephews and Neeces in nature.</p>
                        <p>Now Affinity ariſeth to me two waies; Firſt, by my own kindred, <hi>i. e.</hi> Kinſmen or kinſwomen, when they are married; or by my wives kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or kinſwomen, when I my ſelf am married.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. By my own kindred, as</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By the wives of my Male-kindred; therefore the wives of my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by conſanguinity, are my affairs or allies in the ſame degree of affinity, wherein my ſeveral kinſmen and I ſtood by conſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p>So upwards, my Fathers ſecond wife, or my Step-mother or Mother in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the firſt degree of affinity or alliance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Father and I are in the firſt degree of Conſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p>And downwards, my Sons wife, or my Daughter in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the firſt degree of affinity or alliance; Becauſe my Son and I are in the firſt degree of conſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p>And Sideward, my Brothers wife or Siſter in law is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the ſecond degree; becauſe my brother and I are in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of conſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p>And ſo farther ſideward in the third degree, my Uncles wife, or my Aunt in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the third degree of affinity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Uncle and my Nephew, their husbands are my kinſmen in the third degree of affinity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In like manner <hi>vice versâ,</hi> the Husbands of my kinſwomen, <hi>i. e.</hi> of my Female kindred by conſanguinity, are my <hi>Affines</hi> or Allies in the ſame degree of affinity, wherein my ſeveral kinſwomen and I ſtood by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p>So upwards, my Mothers ſecond husband or my Father in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the firſt degree of affinity or alliance; becauſe my Mother is my kinſwoman in the firſt degree of conſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p>And downwards, my daughters husband, or my Son in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the firſt degree of affinity; becauſe my Daughter is my kinſwoman in the firſt degree of conſanguinity.</p>
                        <p>And Sideward, my Siſters husband, or my Brother in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the ſecond degree of affinity or alliance; becauſe my Siſter is my kinſwoman in the ſecond degree of conſanguinity.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe farther Sideward in the third degree, my Aunts husband, or my Uncle by marriage, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the third degree of affinity; and my Neeces husband, or my Nephew in law, is my <hi>Affinis</hi> or Ally in the third degree of affinity; becauſe correſpondently my Aunt and my Neece are kinſwomen in the third degree of conſanguinity or kindred.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. By my Wives kindred; For,</p>
                        <p>Beſides the affinity ariſing unto me by my own kindred, <hi>i. e.</hi> my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and kinſwomen, there accrues to me, if I be married, a great ſtock of affinity by my wife.</p>
                        <p>Yet a man and his wife are properly of no kin at all, neither by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity nor affinity in any degree of propinquity or nearneſs, neither before marriage nor after.</p>
                        <p>Not before marriage, becauſe their conſanguinity or affinity in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of propinquity, would be ſo juſt an impediment againſt their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:49664:307"/> that thereupon they might not marry at all; or if they did marry, their marriage would be accounted unlawful and inceſtuous.</p>
                        <p>Nor after Marriage, becauſe Conſanguinity and Affinity lie neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily between two perſons, who make the diſtinct terms of thoſe Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But a man and his wife, though naturally and ſenſibly they are two diſtinct perſons, yet Jurally and Legally in the eſtimation of Law, they are no more two, but one perſon; or as the Scripture phraſeth it, <hi>They two are no more two,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Matth. 19.6.</note> 
                           <hi>but one fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, after marriage a man is nearer to his Wife than to his Father and Mother, <hi>for he muſt leave his Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife.</hi> But a mans Conſanguinity with his father and mother is in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and therefore there can be no degree of Conſanguinity with his wife, becauſe there can be no Degree before the firſt.</p>
                        <p>The marriage therefore of Man and Wife effecteth neither Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity nor Affinity, but an Unity, which is a conjunction more entire, more perfect, more eminent, or more tranſcendent than any Conſanguinity or Affinity can poſſibly be.</p>
                        <p>And though this Union by marriage be neither Conſanguinity nor Affinity, yet without marriage there is no lawful Conſanguinity nor Affinity, but Baſtardy.</p>
                        <p>For Marriage is the ground and cauſe of both thoſe Relations, it is the ſeed and root from whence they ſpring, and it is the term or point from whence their degrees are meaſured.</p>
                        <p>And conſequently, a man and his wife are neither <hi>Affines</hi> nor <hi>Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinei,</hi> but <hi>Conjuges;</hi> that is, neither of Alliance nor Blood, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in one perſon in Law, and yoke-fellows in one ſacred band of wedlock. And though in ſome paſſages of the Civil Law they be called <hi>Affines,</hi> yet that appellation muſt be conſtrued for a Metaphor and an Impropriety.</p>
                        <p>Now the Affinity that ariſeth unto me by my Wife, is eaſily computed thus:</p>
                        <p>My Wives <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> or Couſins are <hi>Affines</hi> or Allies to me, and are in the ſame degree of affinity to me, as they ſtand in degree of Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity to her. And therefore my wives own Father and Mother, are my Father-in-law and Mother-in-law, which to me is affinity in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                        <p>So my wives own Brothers and Siſters are my brothers and ſiſters in law, which is affinity in the ſecond degree.</p>
                        <p>So my wives own Uncles and Aunts are my uncles in law and aunts in law, which is affinity in the third degree.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>vice versâ,</hi> my <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> or Couſins are <hi>Affines</hi> or Allies to my wife in the ſame degrees of affinity, as they are to me of conſanguinity. And therefore, my own Father and Mother are my wives Father in law and Mother in law, which is affinity in the firſt degree.</p>
                        <p>So my own Brothers and Siſters are Brothers in law and Siſters in law to my wife, which is affinity in the ſecond degree.</p>
                        <p>And ſo my own Uncles and Aunts, are Uncles in law and Aunts in law to my wife, which is affinity in the third degree.</p>
                        <p>In Affinity therefore, as to the point of Marriage, ſo many degrees are forbidden, as there are reſtrained in conſanguinity by blood.</p>
                        <p>As therefore in Conſanguinity I may not marry any of my kindred, or Couſins in the firſt, ſecond or third degree. So in affinity I may not
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:49664:307"/> marry any of my <hi>Affines</hi> or Allies, in the firſt, ſecond or third degree, whether that affinity ariſe to me from my own kindred, or from my wives kindred.</p>
                        <div n="1" type="section">
                           <head>SECT. I.</head>
                           <p>But it muſt be conſidered, that though Conſanguinity, by the means of marriage, breed Affinity, yet affinity ſo bred begets no farther affinity. As in this caſe; A man may not marry his own Mother in law, becauſe ſhe is his <hi>affinis</hi> or his Fathers wife; but I ſee no reaſon but that a man may marry his wives Mother in law, becauſe though ſhe be <hi>affinis</hi> to his wife, as being her Fathers wife, and therefore her Mother in law, yet ſhe is no <hi>affinis</hi> to him whoſe Mother in law ſhe is not.</p>
                           <p>And therefore, though my wifes kindred or Couſins are Allies to me, yet they are not allies to my kindred or Couſins: So that though my wives Father and Mother are allies to me, yet they are not allies to my own Father and Mother, nor to my own Brothers and Siſters, nor to my own Sons and Daughters, if I had any by my former wife.</p>
                           <p>So likewiſe my wives own Brothers and Siſters, though they be allied to me, yet they are not allied to my own father and mother, nor to my own brothers and ſiſters, nor to my own ſons and daughters, if I had any by my former wife.</p>
                           <p>So again, my wives own Children, if ſhe had any by a former husband, though they be allies to me, yet they are not allies to my own father and mother, nor to my own brothers and ſiſters, nor to my own ſons and daughters, if I had any by a former wife.</p>
                           <p>Hereupon as to the point of Marriage it will follow, that reſpectively to me and my wife three ſorts of Marriages may be lawful:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Firſt upward, That my own father and my wives mother, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Comings being dead, may marry.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe, though my own father be allied to my wife, <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                              </label> yet he is no way allied to my wives own mother: and my wives own mother, though ſhe be allied to me, yet ſhe is no way allied to my own father.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Secondly it will follow Sideward, That my own brother and my wives own ſiſter may marry.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe though my wives own ſiſter be allied to me, <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                              </label> yet ſhe is no way allied to my own brother.</p>
                           <p>So likewiſe, my own ſiſter and my wives own brother may marry for the ſame reaſon; becauſe though my wives own brother be allied to me, yet he is no way allied to my own ſiſter.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thirdly it will follow downward, That my own ſon by a former wife, and my wives own daughter by a former husband, may marry.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe my wives own daughter by another husband, <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                              </label> though ſhe be allied to me, yet ſhe is not allied to my own ſon by another wife.</p>
                           <p>And for the ſame reaſon, my daughter by a former wife, may marry my wives own ſon by a former husband; becauſe my wives own ſon by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband, though he be allied to me, yet he is not allied to my own daughter by a former wife.</p>
                           <p>In ſeveral Inſtances, the practice of theſe three kinds of Marriages hath been, and is known in the world.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Firſt upward, between the Parents of a man and his wife.</p>

                           <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe of Marriage, forbids no more Degrees of Conſanguinity or Affinity than are forbidden in the Civil Law. Yet ſhe numbers and computes the Degrees ſomewhat otherwiſe, following therein the account of the Canon Law: For ſhe accounts Brothers and Siſters to be in the firſt degree of the ſide-line; whereas the Civil Law accounts them in the ſecond degree of the ſide-line, and makes no firſt degree in that line at all. But the matter comes all to one paſs; as ſome Players at Gleek reckon their games differently, and yet accord well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the ſum of the account.</p>
                           <pb n="569" facs="tcp:49664:308"/>
                           <p>For if we conſider the Side-line alone by it ſelf, as there are ſeveral perſons in it, then ſome of thoſe perſons muſt needs make the Firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the ſide-line, in reſpect of the perſons following therein. But if we look upon the ſtandard of the Pedigree, or the perſon whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity is required, and from whom the degrees thereof are meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and numbred upward, downward and ſideward, then the perſons of the firſt degree in the ſide-line, muſt needs make the ſecond degree of Conſanguinity, in reſpect of the ſtandard or perſon ſuppoſed, whoſe Conſanguinity is required, and from whom the Degrees are to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, according to the courſe whereby the blood is derived, which doth conſtitute Conſanguinity, as before hath been intimated.</p>
                           <p>The Levitical Laws for Marriage, do now bind us of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet this truth is to be underſtood with ſome caution.</p>
                           <p>For albeit theſe Laws do bind us, yet they bind us not by divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe their obligation by divine Authority ceaſed, expired, and died at the death of Chriſt. And thereupon all Chriſtian Churches were left to their ſeveral liberties, to follow ſuch rules, orders, meaſures and degrees, as by right Reaſon and Chriſtian prudence ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. For the determination whereof, the Church of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it the moſt prudent courſe, to make the Levitical Law her Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and pattern; and at laſt aſſumed them, and adopted them into her own Canons and Statutes, reviving unto them an obligation, not of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, as once they had from God, but of Humane authority, by the Secular and Eccleſiaſtical power of our Princes and Clergy after the Reformation.</p>
                           <p>Thus theſe very Levitical Laws for Marriage, whoſe obligation by Divine authority was expired long ſince, were afterwards revived unto a New obligation upon us by Humane authority.</p>
                           <p>In like manner divers of the Civil Laws do now oblige us here in <hi>England,</hi> yet not by their original Conſtitution, nor by the Imperial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority either of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> or any other Emperour, but by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our own State, which hath aſſumed and confirmed them into Laws obligatory here in <hi>England,</hi> as they were in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>

                           <p>Not to exclude Baſtards from being the true Sons of God, by Faith and Regeneration, though they are not the true Sons of men by birth and lawful generation; becauſe God is no reſpecter of perſons, and they are innocent, and ſhall not ſuffer for their Parents crimes.</p>
                           <p>Thus Whoremongers and Adulterers, and all inceſtuous perſons that defile the Marriage bed, and all Fornicators, Sodomites and unclean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities I know by cuſtome ſound high, and prevail much to vulgar perſwaſion. But ſolid reaſon is of much more force in it ſelf, and prevails much more with intelligent and unbiaſſed Souls. Examine well the ſcope of all, and without prejudice, and let the Learned correct, qualifie, expunge or add as their wiſdoms ſhall prompt them with all Candour. Hear therefore next to the Holy Scriptures what theſe Learned men do ſay.</p>

We willingly grant it, that we have need therefore of new ſtrength and of new power to be given which may raiſe us up, we deny it not.<note place="margin">Grace.</note> And thirdly, that not only the power but the very act of our recovery is from God, Ingratitude it ſelf cannot deny it. But then, that Man can no more withſtand the power of the Grace, which God is ready to ſupply us with; than an infant can his birth, or the Dead their reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that we are turned whither we will or no, is a concluſion, which thoſe premiſſes will not yield. This flint will yield no ſuch fire, though you ſtrike never ſo oft. We are indeed ſometimes ſaid to ſleep, and ſometimes to be dead in ſin, but it is ill building concluſions, upon no better <hi>baſis</hi> than a figure, and becauſe we are ſaid to be dead in ſin, infer a neceſſity of riſing when we are called. Nor is our obedience to God's inward call of the ſame nature with the obedience of the Creature to the voice and command of the Creator. For the Creature hath neither Reaſon nor Will as Man hath. Nor doth God's power work after the ſame manner in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How many <hi>Fiats</hi> of God have been fruſtrate in this kind? How often hath he ſmote our ſtony and rocky hearts, and no water flow'd out? How often hath he ſaid, <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> Let there be light, and we remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill in darkneſs? We are free Agents, and God hath made us ſo, when he made us Men: And our actions when his power is mighty in us,

Indeed by ſome this, Why will ye die? is made but <hi>Sancta ſimulatio,</hi> a kind of Holy diſſimulation: So that God with them ſetteth up Man as a Mark, and then ſticketh his deadly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in his ſides, and after asketh him why he will die.</p>
                     <p>And, why may he not, ſaith one, with the ſame liberty damn a Soul as a Hunter killeth a Deer?

And though they dare not call God the Author of ſin,) for who is ſo ſinful that could hear that, and not anathematize it?) yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thoſe no Children in underſtanding, think it a concluſion that will naturally and neceſſarily follow upon ſuch bloudy principles. And they are more encouraged by thoſe ill-boading words, which have dropt from their Quils: For, ſay ſome, <hi>Vocat ut induret,</hi> He calleth them to no other end but that he may harden them; he hardneth them that, he may deſtroy them; he exhorteth them to turn that they may not turn; he asketh them why they will die, that they may run on in their evil waies, even upon Death it ſelf. When they break his Command, they fulfil his will, and it is his pleaſure they ſhould ſin, it is his pleaſure they ſhould die. And when he calleth upon them not to ſin, when he asketh them why they will die, he doth but diſſemble: For they are dead already <hi>horribili decreto,</hi> by that horrible antecedaneous Decree of reprobation. —Thou didſt diſtroy us before we were: And if we die, even ſo, good Lord, for it is thy good pleaſure, <hi>Fato volvimur,</hi> it is our Deſtiny, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſt Deus in nobis,</hi> not a <hi>Stoical</hi> fate, but thy right hand and thy ſtrong irreſiſtible arm hath deſtroy'd us. And ſo the expoſtulation is anſwer'd, and the <hi>Quare moriemini?</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Mortui eſtis,</hi> Why will ye die, is the Text; the Gloſs is, Ye are dead already.</p>

For if you make the Kingdom of heaven and the Land of Promiſe all one thing, Then is Baptiſm and the paſſage of the Red Sea all one.

Then (though before he were free) he covenants <hi>ex lege,</hi> to perform the will of the Teſtator: So that every Taſtament at leaſt, when it is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and valid, is a kind of Covenant, and it is the beſt kind of Covenant;

                        </bibl> Seeing therefore that in the New Covenant, whereof Chriſt is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, there are contained better promiſes; therefore it muſt needs be better than the Old, and be ſo much better as the Promiſes are better. Hence it is apparent, that Eternal life was not openly promiſed in the Old Covenant, nor a full forgiveneſs of all ſins; for ſeeing nothing can be found better to men than theſe two things, if both theſe were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Old Covenant, how can the New Covenant be ſaid to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon better promiſes? But we urge this principally concerning the full remiſſion of ſins, for this only is expreſly mentioned in the New Covenant. And we deny not, but that Eternal life was occultly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly compriſed in the promiſes of the Old Covenant, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it; who interprets and takes the words of the Law, promiſing life to them who exactly keep all the precepts of it, to be underſtood of Eternal life and Juſtification, ſuch as we obtain by Chriſt. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. —Notwithſtanding, when the whole Nation had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed of God, and by that puniſhment were brought to a ſenſe of their ſins, and to return to the ſervice of God, then the Law by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, granted them forgiveneſs of all their grievous ſins, in reſpect of all temporary puniſhments for this life, without any ſacrifices intervening. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> But the New Covenant contains a moſt open and clear promiſe of Eternal life. — Beſides the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant requires of no man an exact and abſolute obedience in all points, but is content with true Repentance, and with ſuch an amendment of Life, as carrieth a Will never to offend God more. And therefore truſting to the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, we accuſtome our ſelves afterwards to no ſin, but walk in the ways of all virtues; although it may fall out, that afterward through humane frailty we may ſometimes ſlip; in which point is contained the forgiveneſs of our ſins. They who think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what we have aſſerted, do affirm, That the Promiſes of the New Covenant are therefore called <hi>Better,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>clearer.</hi> But we thereupon demand, Whether they think the old Promiſes ſo clear, that men may certainly know and believe them, by virtue of the Covenant or not? If they ſay, the firſt, that they are ſo clear, then we deny it, not only of the remiſſion of ſins, which the very nature of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law requiring, the merit of Works doth reject, but alſo of Eternal life Neither could the Author call the Promiſes of the new Covenant ſimply better therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are herein propoſed either ſomewhat more clearly, or much more clearly: much leſs could he gather from thence, That the dignity of the new
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:49664:320"/> Covenant was greater than that of the old; and yet again much leſs could he thence infer, that the Prieſthood of Chriſt is better than the Legal; neither was it any way convenient, that therefore the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be abrogated and a new one made. For a declaration of an old Covenant is not a new Covenant diverſe from the old, neither doth ſuch a Declaration abrogate the old, but rather illuſtrate and eſtabliſh it. And a New Covenant doth require, not a declaration of the old, but new Conditions, and new Promiſes made in Gods name. Neither had Chriſt been the Mediator of the New Covenant, but only an Interpreter and Explainer of it. But if they ſay the latter, that they were not ſo clear, we willingly grant that of Eternal life: but not of a full remiſſion of all ſins, given to ſuch as amended their ways; for this was no way contained in the Old Covenant, either openly or covertly, but was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether repugnant to that Covenant. And ſuch a covert Promiſe muſt not be truly accounted for the promiſe of a Covenant, but only ſuch a Promiſe as every man may underſtand and be aſſured of it from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if he perform the Conditions, &amp;c.</p>

Which being no more queſtionable, than it can be queſtioned by thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, whether or no the New Teſtament was intended and deſigned by the Old? whether <hi>Moſes</hi> writ of Chriſt or not? whether Judaiſm was to make way or give place to Chriſtianity or not? And ſeeing it can no more be queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the <hi>Jews</hi> were to take upon them the Law of God as their King, for the condition upon which they were to expect the land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? it is plain, there wants nothing that can be required duely to infer, that the condition, the undertaking whereof entitles Chriſtians to life everlaſting, is the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and the performance thereof, that which is rewarded by the performance of all the promiſes which the Goſpel tenders, as the performance of the Law was that which ſecured the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the land of Promiſe, againſt their enemies round about. Now we know, that when the Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham</hi> for the land of Promiſe came to be limited, as to the condition required by God to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Circumciſion which God had required of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, became a condition limiting the ſame to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> the want whereof at eight days old was a forfeiture of that promiſe. For the waters of the Red Sea, which ſaved them and drowned the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> the Cloud that overſhadowed them, the Manna which they ate, and the waters of the Rock which they drank, though (according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>) Sacraments anſwerable to the Sacraments of the Church, were ſo but for the time that they travelled through the Wilderneſs. If therefore by virtue of theſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were entituled to the land of Promiſe (which of Circumciſion is evident) then muſt the Sacrament of Baptiſm be neceſſarily requiſite to the right of a Chriſtian in the heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

                        <p>So that by publiſhing the Goſpel, the original Law of God is not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, continuing ſtill the Rule of mens actions, but rather ſtrengthned and enlarged to all thoſe Precepts which are poſitive under the Goſpel, and come not from the light of Nature, as neceſſary conditions to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all eſtates. —It may be called a new Law, as propoſing new terms of ſalvation, which if any man challenge to be a derogation to Gods original Law, I will not contend about words. As for the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> if we conſider it as containing the terms upon which the people held the land of Promiſe, the publiſhing of the Goſpel neither abrogates it, nor derogates from it, being only given to hold till the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. — But if we conſider it as containing an intimation of that Spiritual obedience which God required of thoſe that would be ſaved under that light, by the outward and civil obedience of theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Precepts, whereby they were reſtrained from the worſhip of Idols, and commerce with idolatrous Nations in proportion of the reward of the World to come, ſignified by the happineſs of the land of Promiſe; then muſt we acknowledge another diſpenſation in the ſame original Law by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and for the time of it, which was alſo in force under the Fathers from the beginning, though not burthened with that multitude of poſitive Precepts, which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> brought in, for the condition upon which they were to hold the land of Promiſe. And in oppoſition to thoſe it is called by the Fathers of the Church, <hi>The Law of Nature,</hi> not in oppoſition to Grace, the very giving it by Gods vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary appearing to the Fathers, and inſtructing them by familiar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as it were, being a work of meer Grace, as alſo the effect of it in the works of their converſation, which we find ſo truly Chriſtian, that the Fathers of the Church do truly argue from thence, That Judaiſm is younger than Chriſtianity.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I do here acknowledge this his diſpenſation by which the Fathers obtained ſalvation before the Goſpel, to have been granted alſo in conſideration of that obedience, which our Lord Jeſus had taken upon him to perform in the Fulneſs of time. Nothing hindring us to underſtand in Gods proceeding with them, ſomething like that which in the Civil Law is called <hi>Novatio,</hi> or <hi>Delegatio,</hi> renewing of Bonds or Aſſignation of payment, God accepting the interpoſition of our Lord Chriſt, to the reconcilement of them, being as if he accepted a new bond for an old debt, or of payment by Proxie to be made at a certain term.</p>
                        <p>This is a point as manifeſt in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as was requiſite, that a point not concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that live under the New Teſtament; but the underſtanding of the reaſon thereof in the ſalvation of thoſe that died under the Old, for the maintenance of it againſt unbelievers, ſhould be manifeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>I would not have you ignorant, Brethren, that your Fathers were all under the Cloud, and all paſsed through the Sea, and all were baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, and all ate of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and all drank of the ſame ſpiritual drink; for they all drank of the ſame ſpiritual Rock that followed him: Now the Rock was Chriſt.</hi> They that entred into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works to obtain the land of Promiſe, entred not expreſly into a
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:49664:321"/> Covenant of Faith in Chriſt for obtaining the World to come, no more than being baptized into <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud and in the Sea, that is, into his government, into the obſervation of the Laws he ſhould give, in hope of the Promiſes he ſhould give, they can be ſaid to have been baptized expreſly into Chriſt and that Profeſſion which his promiſes require. Wherefore when he ſaith that the Rock was Chriſt, his meaning is not, immediately, and to thoſe that reſted in this temporal Covenant of works: But as the Manna was Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was Chriſt, by the means of that faith which God then received at their hands, to wit, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of everlaſting happineſs, for them who under this calling ſhould tender God the ſpiritual obedience of the inward man, upon thoſe grounds, which his temporal goodneſs, the tradition of their Fathers, and the inſtruction of their Prophets afforded at that time.</p>
                        <p>Now I appeal to the ſenſe of all men, how thoſe can be ſaid to have that intereſt in Chriſt, which I have ſhewed that Chriſtians have (and therefore in the ſame ground) if there were no conſideration of Chriſt, in the Bleſſings of Chriſt, which they enjoyed. Wherefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> proceeds hereupon to exhort them, <hi>Not to tempt Chriſt as ſome of them tempted,</hi> we muſt not underſtand that he forbids us to tempt Chriſt as they tempted God; but that they alſo tempted Chriſt, who went along with them in that Angel in whom the name of God and his word was. So when the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>Moſes counted the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>for he looked at the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Heb. 11.26. when putting them in mind to follow their teachers, conſidering the end which they had attained, and <hi>Moſes</hi> aimed at, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and for everlaſting,</hi> Heb. 13.8. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaies, That <hi>the Prophets who foretold the Goſpel, ſearched againſt what time the Spirit of Chriſt, that was in them, declared and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before hand the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glorious things that followed,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.10. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>all Gods Promiſes are Yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. Methinks it is ſtrange that a Chriſtian ſhould imagine, that there was not conſideration of Chriſt in theſe promiſes, under which they ran the race of Chriſtians. Nor could St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>As by Adam all die, ſo by Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. Nor could the compariſon hold between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam, Ro.</hi> 5.12. —19. if that life, which I have ſhewed, Chriſt reſtores Chriſtians to, were given to the Fathers before Chriſt, without conſideration of Chriſt. Nor could the Apoſtle otherwiſe ſay, That <hi>Chriſt is the Mediatour of the New Covenant, that death coming for the ranſom of thoſe tranſgreſſions that were under the old, they that are called may receive the promiſe of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9.15. But becauſe thoſe ſins which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed only to a temporal effect, by the ſacrifices of the old Law (as alſo thoſe which were not redeemed at all by any) were by the ſacrifice of Chriſt redeemed to the purchaſe of the World to come. Which is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 13.29. That <hi>through Chriſt every one that believeth is juſtified from all things, which they could not be juſtified of by the Law of Moſes.</hi> For as the Law did not expiate capital offences, ſo it expiated none, but to the effect of a civil promiſe. And though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue the words of St. <hi>John,</hi> Apoc. 13.8. <hi>Whoſe names are not written in the book of the Lamb, ſlain from the foundation of the World;</hi> out of the ſame ſenſe repeated, <hi>Ap.</hi> 13.8. Not that the Lamb was ſlain from the foundation of the world, but that their names were written in his book
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:49664:321"/> from the foundation of the world, yet inaſmuch as it is called the book of the Lamb, <hi>that was foreknown from the foundation of the World,</hi> 1 Pet. 19. When <hi>Moſes</hi> demands not to be written in Gods book, when mention is made of it in the New Teſtament, it muſt be the book of Chriſt in the myſtical ſenſe. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt gaeve himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for all; A teſtimony for due time,</hi> what can he mean, but that though he gave himſelf for all, yet this was not to be teſtified till the proper time of the preaching of the Goſpel? And what is this, but that though this is teſtified only by the preaching of the Goſpel, yet he was a ranſom for all. Which reaſon ſuffers not the ſame term <hi>All, Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.23. to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that generality which it naturally ſignifies. Laſtly, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argues, that <hi>if Chriſt ſhould offer himſelf more than once, that he might more than once enter into the Holy of Holies, he muſt have ſuffered oft from the foundation of the World,</hi> that is, before the end of the World, in which he came indeed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26. he muſt needs ſuppoſe that he ſuffered for all that were ſaved before the Goſpel. For what pretence can there be that he ſhould ſuffer for ſins under the Goſpel, before the Goſpel, more than that the High Prieſt before the Law, ſhould expiate thoſe ſins which were committed againſt the Law, by entring in to the Holie of Holies. And here you may ſee that I intend not to affirm, that all that were ſaved under the Law, though in conſideration of Chriſt, did know in what conſideration Chriſt ſhould be their ſalvation, as Chriſtians under the Goſpel do. But to refer my ſelf to the determination of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and other Fathers and Doctors of the Church, that they underſtood it in their Elders and Superiors, the Prophets of God and their Diſciples, the Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who were alſo Prophets) and the Fathers of ſeveral ages, of whom you read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Who being acquainted with the ſecret of Gods purpoſe, were to acquaint the people with it, ſo ſparingly and by ſuch degrees, as the ſecret wiſdom of God had appointed.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, I do acknowledge and challenge the act of God, in diſpenſing in the execution of his original Law, and bringing the Goſpel into effect inſtead of it; not to be the act of a private perſon, remitting this particular intereſt in the puniſhment of thoſe ſins whereby his Law was tranſgreſſed: But the Act of a Maſter of a houſhold, or the Prince and Soveraign of a Commonwealth, which you pleaſe, diſpoſing of Mankind, as his Subjects or Houſhold Servants, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>— In the Religion of the old World, the Religion of Sacrifices and conſumptive oblations, it is certain themſelves did not chooſe by natural reaſon, but they were taught and enjoyn'd by God. For that it is no part of a natural Religion to kill,<note place="margin">Sacrifices.</note> and offer to God Wine and Fat, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Nature of the things themſelves, the cauſe of their inſtitution, and the Matter of Fact, that is the evidence that they came in by poſitive Conſtitution. For Blood was anciently the ſanction of Laws and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants; <hi>Sanctio à Sanguine,</hi> ſay the Grammarians, becauſe the Sanction or eſtabliſhment of Laws, was that which bound the life of Man to the law, and therefore when the Law was broken the Life or Blood was forfeited: But then as in Covenants, in which ſometime the wilder people did drink Blood, the gentler and more civil did drink Wine, the blood of the Grape: So in the forfeiture of Lands, they alſo gave the blood of Beaſts in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for their own.</p>
                        <p>Now that this was leſs than what was done, is certain, and therefore it muſt ſuppoſe remiſſion and grace, a favourable and gracious acceptation, which becauſe it is voluntary and arbitrary in God, leſs than his due, and more than our merit, no natural reaſon can teach us to appeaſe God with Sacrifices. It is indeed agreeable unto reaſon that blood ſhould be poured forth, when the life is to be paid becauſe the blood is the life: But that one life ſhould redeem another, that the blood of a Beaſt ſhould be taken in exchange for the life of a man; That no reaſon naturally can teach us. <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.29. <hi>The life of the fleſh is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an atonement for poor ſouls; for it is the Blood that maketh an atonement for the Soul:</hi> according to which are thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul, Without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion;</hi> meaning that in the Law all expiation of ſins was by Sacrifices, to which Chriſt by the ſacrifice of himſelf put a period. But all this was by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but no part of a Law of Nature.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe God confined it amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to the family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and that only in the land of their own Inheritance, the Land of promiſe, which could no more be done in a natural Religion, than the Sun can be confin'd to a Village Chappel.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe God did expreſs oftentimes, that <hi>he took no delight in the ſacrifices of Beaſts,</hi> Pſal. 40, Pſ. 50, Pſ. 51. Iſ. 1. Jer. 7. Hoſ. 6. Mich. 6.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe he tells us in oppoſition to Sacrifices and external Rites, what that is which is the natural and eſſential Religion in which he does delight. <hi>The ſacrifice of Prayer and Thankſgiving; a broken and a contrite heart; that we ſhould walk in the way which he hath appointed; that we ſhould do juſtice, and love mercy, and walk humbly with our God. He deſires Mercy and not Sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Becauſe <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Arch-angel foretold, that <hi>the Meſſias ſhould make the daily ſacrifice to ceaſe.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. Becauſe for above 1600 years, God hath ſuffered that Nation to whom he gave the Law of Sacrifices, to be without Temple, or Prieſt, or
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:49664:322"/> Altar, and therefore without Sacrifice. But then, if we enquire why God gave the Law of Sacrifices, and was ſo long pleaſed with it, the Reaſons are evident and confeſs't:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Sacrifices were types of that great oblation which was made upon the Altar of the Croſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It was an Expiation which was next in kind to the real forfeiture of our own lives, it was blood for blood, a life for a life, a leſs for a greater; it was that which might make us confeſs Gods ſeverity againſt ſin, though not feel it. It was enough to make us hate the ſin, but not to ſink under it. It was ſufficient for a ſine, but ſo as to preſerve the ſtate. It was a Manuduction to a great Sacrifice, but ſuppletory of the great loſs and forfeiture. It was enough to glorifie God, and by it to ſave our ſelves. It was inſufficient in it ſelf, but accepted in the great Sacrifice. It was enough in ſhadow, when the ſubſtance was ſo certainly to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It was given the <hi>Jews,</hi>

And as that was to be ſpent in praiſes and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his name, ſo theſe were to be given in conſumptive offerings; but the manner and meaſure was left to choice, and taught by ſuperadded reaſons and poſitive Laws, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>I know it is ſaid very commonly, and the Caſuiſts do commonly uſe that method, That the explication of the Decalogue is the ſum of all their moral Theology, but how inſufficiently, the foregoing Inſtances do ſufficiently demonſtrate.

God intending by ſeveral portions of the eternal or natural Law, to bring the world to that perfection from whence Mankind by ſin did fall; and by Chriſt to enlarge this Natural Law, to a ſimilitude and conformity to God himſelf, as far as our Infirmities can bear.</p>

                        <p>That which is true to day will be true to morrow, and that which is in its own nature good or neceſſary, is good or neceſſary every day, and therefore there is no eſſential duty of the Religion, but is to be the work of every day, To confeſs Gods glory, to be his ſubject, to love God, to be ready to do him ſervice, to live according to nature, and to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to be chaſt, to be temperate, to be juſt; theſe are the employments of all the periods of a Chriſtians life.

                        <p>Thoſe who in the Primitive Church put off their Baptiſm to the time of their death, knew that Baptiſm was a profeſſion of holineſs, and an undertaking to keep the Faith, and live according to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Jeſus Chriſt; and that as ſoon as ever they were baptized, that is, as ſoon as ever they had made profeſſion to be Chriſts Diſciples, they were bound to keep all the laws of Chriſt; and therefore that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Baptiſm, was ſo egregious a prevarication of their duty, that as in all reaſon it might ruine their hopes, ſo it proclaimed their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the world. For as ſoon as ever they were convinced in their underſtanding, they were obliged in their Conſciences. And although Baptiſm does publiſh the Profeſſion,<note place="margin">Baptiſm.</note> and is like the forms and ſolemnities of law; yet a man is bound to live the life of a Chriſtian as ſoon as ever he believes the doctrines and commandments of Chriſtianity, for indeed he is obliged as ſoon as he can uſe reaſon, or hear reaſon. The firſt things a man can learn are ſome parts of Chriſtianity, Not to hurt any one, to do all that he can underſtand to be good, that is, as ſoon as ever he begins to live like a rational Creature, ſo ſoon he begins to live like as Chriſt commanded: And ſince Baptiſm (as to this relation and intention of it) is nothing elſe but the publication of our undertaking, to do that which in our very nature, and by the firſt and univerſal laws of God to Mankind we are obliged; To refuſe to be baptized, or to defer it, is nothing but a refuſing or deferring to own our natural obligation, a denying or not accepting the duty of living according to the law of Nature: Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, as it muſt needs be the Argument of an evil man, and an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unwillingneſs to live worthily, ſo it can ſerve really no prudent ends to which it can fallaciouſly pretend.<note place="margin">Natural Law.</note> For Chriſtianity being in its moral part nothing but the perfection of the natural Law, binds no more upon us than God does by the very reaſon of our Nature. By the Natural law we are bound to live in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the daies of our life; and ſo we are by the Chriſtian law, as appears in the Song of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and in very many other places: And therefore, although when ſome of our time is elapſed, and loſt in careleſneſs and folly, the goodneſs of God will admit us to ſecond counſels, and the Death of Chriſt and his Interceſſion will make them acceptable; yet Chriſtianity obliges us to obedience as ſoon as the law of Nature does, and we muſt profeſs to live according to Chriſtianity, as ſoon as we can live by the meaſures of the Natural law, and that is even in the very infancy of our Reaſon. And therefore Baptiſm is not to be deferred longer; it may be ſooner, becauſe ſome little images of choice and reaſon, which muſt be conducted by the meaſures of Nature, appear even in infancy; but it muſt not be deferred longer, there is no excuſe for that, becauſe there can be no reaſon

                        <p>The Bleſſed Maſter began his office with a Sermon of Repentance, as his predeceſſor <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did in his miniſtration, to tell the world, that the New Covenant which was to be eſtabliſhed by the Mediation and office of the Holy Jeſus, was a Covenant of Grace and Favour, not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon Works but upon Promiſes, and remiſſion of right on Gods part, and remiſſion of ſins on our part. The Law was a Covenant of Works, and whoever prevaricated any of its ſanctions, in a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree, he ſtood ſentenced by it without any hopes of reſtitution ſupplied by the Law. And therefore it was the Covenant of Works, not becauſe good works were then required more than now,<note place="margin">Law and Goſpel.</note> or becauſe they had more efficacy than now; but becauſe all our hopes did rely upon the perfection of Works and innocence, without the ſuppletories of Grace, pardon and repentance. But the Goſpel is therefore a Covenant of Grace, not that works are excluded from our duty, or from co-operating to heaven; but becauſe there is in it ſo much mercy that the imperfections of the works are made up by the grace of Jeſus, and the defects of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence are ſupplied by the ſubſtitution of Repentance. Abatements are made for the infirmities and miſeries of humanity, and if we do our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour now after the manner of men, the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, that is, conformity to his laws and ſubmiſſion to his doctrines, entitles us to the grace he hath purchaſed for us; that is, our ſins for his ſake ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. So that the Law and the Goſpel are not oppoſed barely upon the title of Faith and Works, but as the Covenant of Faith and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works. In the faith of a Chriſtian works are the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, and the chief of the conſtitution; but the Goſpel is not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, that is, it is not an agreement upon the ſtock of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, without allowances of Repentance, requiring obedience in rigour and ſtricteſt eſtimate. But the Goſpel requires the holineſs of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and yet after the manner of a man, for alwaies provided that we do not allow to our ſelves a liberty, but endeavour with all our ſtrength, and love with all our ſoul that which if it were upon our allowance would be required at our hands, now, that it is againſt our will and highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt, is put upon the ſtock of Chriſt, and allowed unto us by God in the accounts of pardon, by the merits of Jeſus, by the Covenant of the Goſpel; <hi>v.

                        <p>As the Philoſophers agree there was a Chief-good and Happineſs which Man might attain to, but could not agree what it was; ſo it hath fallen out with Chriſtians: They all conſent that there is mercy with God, that we may be ſaved. They make remiſſion of ſins an Article of their Creed: But then they reſt not here, but to the covering of their ſins, require a garment of Righteouſneſs of their own thred and ſpinning, to the blotting out of their ſins ſome bloud and ſome virtue of their own, and to the purging them out, ſome infuſed habit of inherent Righteouſneſs. And ſo by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, and additions and Gloſſes they leave this Article in a cloud, than which the day it ſelf is not clearer. As <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> when a new Star appeareth in their <hi>Hemiſphere,</hi> diſpute and altercate till that Star go out, and remove it ſelf out of their ſight: So have we diſputed and talked Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and remiſſion of ſins almoſt out of ſight. For there is nothing more plain and even, without rub or difficulty, nothing more open to the eye, and yet nothing at which the quickeſt apprehenſions have been more dazled. — It hath been the fault of Chriſtians when the Truth lay in their way,<note place="margin">Juſtification.</note> to paſs it by, or leap over it, and to follow ſome fancies and imaginations of their own. — Nor was this Doctrine only blemiſhed by thoſe monſters of Men, who ſate down and conſulted, and do deliberately give ſentence againſt the Truth, but received ſome blot and ſtain from their hands, who were the ſtouteſt Champions for it. Who though they ſaw the Truth, and did acknowledg it, yet let that fall from their Pews, which poſterity after took up to obſcure this Doctrine, and would not reſt content with that, which is as much as we can deſire, and more than we can deſerve, remiſſion of ſins. Hence it was that we were taught in the Schools, That Juſtification is a change from a ſtate of unrighteouſneſs to a ſtate of Righteouſneſs. That as in every motion there is a leaving of one Term to acquire another, ſo in Juſtification there is expulſion of ſin, and infuſion of Grace: Which is moſt true in the <hi>concrete,</hi> but not in the <hi>abſtract</hi> in the juſtified Perſon; but not in Juſtification which is an act of God alone. From hence theſe <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="603" facs="tcp:49664:326"/> is not to pronounce, but to make him juſt; That the Formal cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is Inherent ſanctity; that our Righteouſneſs before God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not only in Remiſſion of ſins; that we may redeem our ſins as well as Chriſt, we from temporal, as he from eternal pain. And then this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition muſt run thus, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> that is, make us ſo juſt, that we may need no forgiveneſs: Forgive us the breach of the law, becauſe we have kept the Law; forgive us our ſins for our good works: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me my intemperance for my often faſting, my incontinency for my zeal, my oppreſſion for my alms, my murther for the Abby and Hoſpital which I built, my fraud, my malice, my oppreſſion, for the many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons I have heard. A conceit which I fear findeth more room and friendly entertainment in thoſe hearts which are ſoon hot, at the very mention of Popery and Merit. In a word, they ſay and unſay, ſometimes bring in remiſſion of ſins, and ſometimes their own ſatisfaction, and ſo ſet St. <hi>Paul</hi> and their Church at ſuch a diſtance, that neither St. <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor all the Angels and Saints ſhe prayeth to, will be able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, and make his Gratis and their Merits meet in one.

Bring in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and all the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Apoſtles, and deck them with all thoſe vertues which made them glorious, but yet they ſinned. Bring in the noble Army of Martyrs, who ſhed their blood for Chriſt, but yet they ſinned. <hi>They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, they were ſlain with the ſword,</hi> but yet they ſinned, and he that ſinneth is preſently the ſervant of ſin, obnoxious to it for ever, and cannot be redeemed by his own blood, becauſe he ſinned, but by the blood of him in whom there was no ſin to be found, <hi>Juſtificatio Impii,</hi> this one form of ſpeech of Juſtifying a ſinner doth plainly exclude the Law and the Works of it, and may ſerve as an Axe or Hammer to beat down all their carved work, and thoſe Anticks which are faſtned to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which may perhaps take a wandring or gadding fancy, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter the heart of a man of underſtanding. We do not find that beauty in their artificial and forced inventions, that we do in the ſimple and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive truth. Neither are thoſe effects, which are as irradiations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultances from forgiveneſs of ſin, ſo viſible in their Juſtification by faith and works, as in the free remiſſion which is by faith alone. The urging of our Merits is of no force to make our peace with God: They may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make us gracious in his eyes after remiſſion, but have as much power to remove our ſins, as our breath hath to remove a mountain, or put out the fire of hell: For every ſin is, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaketh, of that of <hi>Alexander</hi> in killing <hi>Calliſthenes, Crimen aeternum,</hi> an Eternal crime, which no vertue of our own can redeem. —Let me add my paſſions to my actions, my

Nothing but Merit in their ruff and jollity, and nothing but Mercy on their Death-Beds; nothing but the Bloud of Martyrs then, and nothing but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s now; nothing but their own ſatisfaction all their lives, and nothing but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s at their laſt gaſpe. Before, <hi>Magis honorificum,</hi> it was more honourable, to bring in ſomething of our own towards the forgiveneſs of our ſins; but none for the uncertainty of our own Righteouſneſs. —Becauſe there is no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour here; <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is called in, with a <hi>Tutiſſimum eſt,</hi> as the beſt ſhelter: And here they will abide till the ſtorm be overpaſt.</p>

For though Men have been willing to go under the name of juſtified perſons, yet have they have been buſie to enquire how Juſtification hath been wrought in them. They are juſtified they know not how. Many and divers opinions have been broach'd amongſt the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> and <hi>Confeſſioniſts,</hi> and others. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiander</hi> nameth twenty, and there are many more at this day: And yet all may conſiſt well enough, for ought I ſee; and ſtill that ſenſe,<note place="margin">Juſtification.</note> which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in Scripture as neceſſary, remains entire: For 1. it is neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That no Man can be juſtified by the works of Law, preciſely taken; and in this all agree. 2. It is neceſſary to believe that we are not juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> either by it ſelf, or joyn'd with Faith in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and in this all agree. 3. That Juſtification is not without remiſſion of ſins, and imputation of Righteouſneſs; and in this all agree. 4. That a dead Faith doth not juſtifie; and here is no difference. 5. That that is a dead Faith which is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with good works, and a holy and ſerious purpoſe of good Life: And in this all agree. Laſtly, that Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> implyeth an adviſed and deliberate aſſent, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our Prophet and Prieſt and King.—And in this all agree. <hi>Da, ſi quid ultra eſt.</hi> —And what is more is but a vapour. —But thoſe interpretations—which have been made upon this <hi>Nihil am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliùs quam ſonant. —Nec animum faciunt quia non habent.</hi> —What matter is it whether I believe or not believe, know or not know that our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth conſiſt in one or more acts, ſo that I certainly know and believe that it is the greateſt Bleſſing that God can let fall upon his Creature, and believe that by it I am made acceptable in his ſight, and though I have broke the Law, yet I ſhall be dealt with as if I had been juſt and righteous indeed; whether it be done by pardoning all my ſins, or imputing univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal obedience to me, or the active or paſſive obedience of <hi>Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned and we die. We were all in the loyns of that one Man <hi>Adam,</hi> when that one Man ſlew us all. And this we are too ready to confeſs, that we are born in ſin. Nay,<note place="margin">Original Sin.</note> we fall ſo low as to damn our ſelves before we were born. This ſome may do in humility, but moſt are content it ſhould be ſo, well pleaſed in their Pedigree, well pleaſed that they are brought into the World, and in that filth and uncleanneſs that God doth hate, and make the unhappineſs of their Birth an Advocate to plead for thoſe pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, for thoſe willful and beloved ſins which they fall into, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of their life, as being the proper and natural iſſues of the weakneſs and impotency with which we were ſent into the World. But this is not true in every part. That weakneſs whatſoever it is can draw no ſuch neceſſity upon us, nor can be wrought into an Apology for ſin, or an excuſe for dying. For to conclude and wrap up all our actual ſin in the folds of Original weakneſs, is nothing elſe but to cancel our old obligations, and to put all on our firſt Parents ſcore, and ſo make <hi>Adam</hi> guilty of the ſins of the whole World. Our natural and original weakneſs I will not now
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:49664:328"/> call into queſtion, ſince it hath had ſuch Grandees in our Church, Men of great learning and piety for its Nurſing Fathers, and that for many centuries of years; but yet I cannot ſee why it ſhould be made a cloak to cover our other tranſgreſſions, or why we ſhould miſcarry ſo often with an eye caſt back upon our firſt Fall, which is made ours, but in another man. Nor any reaſon though it be a plant water'd by the beſt hands, why men ſhould be ſo delighted in it, why they ſhould lie down and repoſe themſelves under its ſhadow; why they ſhould be ſo willing to be weak, and ſo unwilling to hear the contrary; why men ſhould take ſo much pains to make the way to happineſs narrower, and the way to death broader than it is. In a word, why we ſhould thus magnifie a temptation and diſparage our ſelves; why we ſhould make each importunate object as powerful and irreſiſtible as God himſelf,<note place="margin">Petrar.</note> and our ſelves as Idols, even nothing in this world. <hi>Magna pars humanarum querelarum, non injuſta modò materiâ, ſed ſtulta eſt;</hi> for when our ſouls are preſſed down and overcharged with ſin, when we feel the gripes and gnawings of our Conſcience, we commonly lay hold on thoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are worſe than the diſeaſe, &amp; ſuborn an unſeaſonable and ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied conceit of our own natural weakneſs (which is more dangerous than the temptation) as an excuſe and comfort of our overthrow. We fall and plead we were weak, and fall more than ſeven times a day and hold up the ſame plea ſtill, till we fall into that ſame place where we ſhall be muzled and ſpeechleſs not able to ſay a word, where our complaints will end in curſes, in weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth. <hi>Omnes noſtris vitiis favemus, &amp; quod propriâ facimus voluntate ad naturae referimus neceſſitatem;</hi> we are all tender and favourable to our own ſins, and becauſe they pleaſed us when we committed them. We are unwilling to revile them now, but wipe off as much of their filth as we can, becauſe we reſolve to commit them again: And thoſe tranſgreſſions which our luſts conceived and brought forth by the midwifry of our will, we remove as far as we can, and lay them at the door of neceſſity, &amp; are ready to complain of God and Nature it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Now, this complaint againſt Nature when we have ſinned is moſt unjuſt, for God and Nature have imprinted in our Souls, thoſe common principles of goodneſs. That good is to be embraced, and evil is to be abandoned, that we muſt do to others as we would be done to. Thoſe practical notions, thoſe anticipations, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> call them, of the mind, &amp; preparations againſt ſin &amp; death, which, if we did not willfully ſtifle and choak them, might lift up our Souls far above thoſe depreſſions of Self-love and Covetouſneſs; and thoſe evils which deſtroy us, <hi>quae ratio ſemel in univerſum vincit,</hi> which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the help of Grace, overcometh at once. For Reaſon doth not only arm and prepare us againſt thoſe inroads &amp; incurſions, againſt thoſe (as we think) ſo violent aſſaults, but alſo, when we are beat down to the ground, it checketh us, and upbraideth us for our fall. Indeed to look down upon our ſelves, and then lift up our eyes to him from whom cometh our Salvation, is both the duty and ſecurity of the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> And when we watch over our ſelves, and keep our hearts with diligence, when we ſtrive with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination &amp; weakneſs, as well as we do with the temptation, then if we fall God remembreth whereof we are made, conſidereth our condition, that we are but Men; and though we fail, his mercy endureth for ever. But to think of our weakneſs and then to fall; and becauſe we came infirm and diſeaſed into the World, to kill our ſelves, to ſeek out death in the error of our life, to dally and play with danger, to be willing to joyn with the temptation at the firſt ſhew and approach, as if we were made for no other end than to complain of weakneſs, is to charge God and Nature fooliſhly, &amp; not only to impute our ſins to <hi>Adam,</hi> but to God himſelf. And thus we bankrupt our ſelves,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:49664:328"/> and complain we were born poor; we cripple our ſelves, and then we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain we are lame; we deliver up our ſelves, and fall willingly under the temptation, and then pretend it was a Son of <hi>Anak,</hi> too ſtrong for ſuch graſhoppers as we. We delight in ſin, we trade in ſin, we were brought up in it, and we continue in it, and make it our Companion, our Friend with which we moſt familiarly converſe, and then comfort our ſelves, and caſt all the fault on our temper and conſtitution, and the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we attribute our full growth in ſin, to that ſeed of ſin, which we ſhould have chok'd, which had never ſhot up into the blade, and born ſuch evil fruit, but that we manured and watered it, and were more than wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that it ſhould grow and multiply. And this though it be a great ſin, as being the mother of all thoſe miſhapen births, and monſters which walk about the World, we dreſss and deck up, and give it a fair and glorious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and call it Humility. Which is, ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi> the hardeſt and greateſt work of our Faith, to which it is ſo unlike, that it is the greateſt enemy it hath, and every day weakeneth and diſenabled it; that it doth not work by Charity, but leaves us captives to the World and Sin: which, but for this conceit we would eaſily vanquiſh &amp; tread down under our feet. We may call it Humility, but it is Pride, a ſtubborn and inſolent ſtanding out with God that made us, upon this foul and unjuſt pretenſe, that he made us ſo. <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas ſophiſtica,</hi> ſaith <hi>Petrus Bleſenſis,</hi> the Humility of Hypocrites, which at once boweth and puſheth out the horn, in which we diſgrace and condemn our ſelves that we may do what we pleaſe, and ſpeak evil of our ſelves, that we may be worſe. O wretched Men that we are! we groan it out, &amp; there is Muſick in the ſound, which we hear and delight in, and carry along in our mind, and ſo become wretched indeed; even thoſe miſerable Sinners which will ever be ſo. And ſhall we call this Humility? If it be,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ro.</hi> 7.24.</note> it is as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, a <hi>Voluntary humility,</hi> but in a worſe ſenſe: he is the humbleſt Man that doth his duty; for that humility which is commended to us in Scripture lifteth us up to Heaven. This which is ſo epidemical, ſinketh us into the loweſt pit: That Humility boweth us down with ſorrow, this bindeth our handswith ſloth; that looketh upon our imperfections paſt, this maketh way for more to come, that ventureth and condemneth it ſelf, and ventureth farther; this runneth out of the field, and dare not look upon the enemy. <hi>Nec mirum ſi vincantur, qui jam victi ſunt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For firſt, though I deny not a derived weakneſs, and from <hi>Adam,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Weakneſs.</note> though I leave it not after Baptiſm as ſubſiſtent by it ſelf, or bound to the Center of the Earth, with the <hi>Manichee,</hi> nor waſht to nothing in the Fount, with others; yet it is eaſie to deceive our ſelves, and to think it more contagious than it is, more operative &amp; more deſtructive than it would be, if we would ſhake off this conceit, and rowſe our ſelves, and ſtand up againſt it. <hi>Ignaviâ noſtrâ fortis eſt:</hi> It may be it is our ſloth and cowardiſe that maketh it ſtrong. Certainly there muſt be more force than this hath, to make us ſo wicked as many times we are, and there be more promoters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs in us than that which we brought into the World. Lord, what a noiſe hath Original ſin made amongſt the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and what ill uſe hath been made of it? When this Lion roareth, all the Beaſts of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt tremble, and yet are Beaſts ſtill. We hear of it and are aſtoniſhed, and become worſe and worſe; and yet there are but few that exactly know what it is. When we are in faults, we do not know that we are ſo, no more than the Tree that it grows: Much leſs can we diſcover what poyſon we brought with us into the World, which, (as it is the nature of ſome kind of poyſon) though it
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:49664:329"/> have no viſible operation for the preſent, may ſome years after break out from the head to the foot in ſwellings and ſores full of corruption, and not be fully purged out to our lives end. Again, in the opening and drawing of our Reaſon, we have ſcarce ſo much light, as to ſee our ſelves by, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand little more than the rod, which we ſoon forget, &amp; boldly venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame fault for which we felt it, and ſhould count it a virtue, and our bounden duty to do it, but for the ſmart it bringeth with it, which yet can work in us little conſcience of guilt: And then in our riper age our Bloud runneth in our Veins with more heat, and we are active and ſtrong to act over that with ſome ſenſe and feeling, which we learnt but imperfectly in our Nonage, which our Nurſe pratled into us, which Servants read to us with a licentious tongue and wanton behaviour, and many times we repeat and expreſs thoſe Rudiments and Principles of things, which thoſe that are ſet over us, do commonly firſt teach, and we ſhew our ſelves as perfect in them as thoſe old gray headed <hi>Atheiſts</hi> that taught them: Theſe we take up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, wantonneſs, revenge, love of the World; and being uſed unto them, they are no burdens, &amp; if at any time they wring us, we have learnt ſo much at Church, as to caſt them off upon <hi>Adam,</hi> to eaſe our ſelves with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our natural weakneſs, though we know not what it is, nor have learnt it half ſo perfectly, as we have done thoſe other Leſſons, which have no evil in them as we think. But that which is of ancient extraction derived from the firſt evil that ever was ſeen under the Sun. But then in our old age, which is a complication and collection of all ſins, as well as diſeaſes, how ſhould a dim eye diſcover it in the midſt of ſo many evil habits, wreathed &amp; platted one within another. Covetouſneſs wrought in with luxury, and with luxury cruelty, each thwarting and yet friendlily complying one with the other? Can we now ſay, That theſe ſins were thus multiplied and raiſed to ſuch a height by the power and continued force of that fatal le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy which our firſt Parents left us? Nor was this the laſt Crime, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Mother crown'd us in the day of our conception. Can we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toil, can we affect and ſtudy ſin, can we make it our buſineſs, our ambition, to walk in our evil waies, and ſay that we were put in them from the beginning, and forced forward by the violent hand that firſt put us in? Indeed the Old Man, the old Sinner, is glad to hear of another Old Man, though he never intendeth to crucifie him, nor well underſtandeth what it is, no more than the vulgar do <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which in their phraſe is a Beaſt, and hath horns. Multitude of years, though Age be talkative, yet many times knows no more of this Primitive and famed evil than they do who are but of yeſterday. Even they who have been brought up in <hi>Nob,</hi> in the City and Univerſity of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> have not all agreed of their diſcovery of this evil, but have preſented it in ſo many ſhapes, that it will be hard to chuſe and ſay, This is the right, this, this it is. I am ſure that their opinions are more than the ſins can be, which original ſin doth neceſſarily bring into act. The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in the daies of our Fore-Fathers, called it <hi>Somnium Auguſtini:</hi> Some make it a ſin, and ſome a puniſhment only, ſome make it both. Some have made it nothing but the want and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of original Righteouſneſs, or an habitual averſion and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Will: Others have made it the image of the Devil. There be that conceive the whole eſſence of Man to be corrupted; there be that make it an Accident, and there have been that have made it a ſubſtance. And there have not been wanting thoſe who have made it nothing. All agree in this, That there is ſomething in us which we muſt ſtrive to ſubdue
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:49664:329"/> and keep under, Some call it our Natural inclination, which may be the matter of vertue as well as of vice. Others, Original ſin, which to yield to is to die, but to curb and reſtrain, to fight againſt and conquer it, is the great work and buſineſs of a Chriſtian. I ſpeak not this to take away our original weakneſs, but to take it away from being an excuſe. For,</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, our Natural weakneſs is ſo far from excuſing our ſin, or making of it leſs voluntary, that we are bound by our very Profeſſion to crucifie this old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, to mortifie our earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and luſts; <hi>non exercere quod nati ſumus,</hi> not to be what indeed we are, to be in the body, but out of the body, to tame the wantonneſs of the fleſh: For did we not for this give up our names unto Chriſt? Were we not baptized in this Faith? It is my Melancholy, ſaith the Envious. It is my Choler, ſaith the Revenger. It is my Blood, ſaith the Wanton. It is my Appetite, ſaith the Glutton; and ſo every man runneth on his own ways, becauſe the wind that driveth him cometh from no other treaſury but himſelf, no other corner but his corrupt heart. <hi>Fructu peccatorum utuntur, ipſa ſubducunt:</hi> They are content to reap the fruit and pleaſure of ſin, but withdraw the ſin it ſelf and remove it out of the way. But this is not the right uſe of our Natural weakneſs, which may be left in us, but (as all agree) to humble, not diſarm us; to ſhew we are men weak and impotent in our ſelves, not to make us proud and rebellious againſt our God; but to ſet us upon our guard, and to make us beſtir our ſelves, and caſt up all our forces, and ſend our Prayers and Ambaſſadours to heaven for help and ſuccour againſt this Inmate and domeſtick enemy. The Envious ſhould purge his melancholy,<note place="margin">Ro. 12.15.</note> and <hi>rejoyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and weep with them that weep.</hi> The Cholerick bridle his Anger, and make it ſet before the Sun. The Wanton quench that fire in his blood, and make himſelf an Eunuch for the kingdom of heaven. The Glutton, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, wage war with his Appetite, and ſet a knife to his throat. If this care were general, if we underſtood Chriſtianity aright, and did ſtrive and ſtruggle with our ſelves (the beſt contention in the World) if we did do an act of juſtice upon our ſelves, perform that Judicatory part of the Goſpel, labour to bind this old Man in chains, and crucifie the fleſh with the luſts and affections, we ſhould not complain, or rather ſpeak ſo contentedly of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall; not bemoan our ſelves, and yet be pleaſed well enough in it; not take that doctrine in the left hand, which is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us with the right; or as he ſpake in the Hiſtorian, <hi>Siniſtrâ dextram amputare,</hi> and by a ſiniſter and unneceſſary conceit of our own weakneſs, rob and deprive our ſelves of that ſtrength which might have defended us from ſin and death, which now is voluntary, becauſe we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from any other fountain than our own wills. For</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all, the blemiſhes of our Underſtanding and Will, which we are ſaid to receive by <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall; what they may be either by certain knowledge or conjecture, yet we ſhall not die unleſs we will. And if ſuch <hi>we were all, yet now we are waſhed, now we are ſanctified,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12.</note> 
                           <hi>now we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the Leper who is cleanſed complaineth no more of his diſeaſe, but returneth to give thanks. The Blind man who is cured doth not run into the ditch, and impute it to his former blindneſs; but rejoyceth that he can now ſee the light, and walk by the light he ſeeth. And we cannot without foul ingratitude deny, but what we loſt in <hi>Adam</hi> we recovered again in Chriſt, and that improved and exalted many degrees. For, <hi>not as the offence, ſo is alſo the free gift,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 5.15, &amp;c.</note>
                           <pb n="610" facs="tcp:49664:330"/> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>For as by the offence of one many were made ſinners,</hi> that is, were under the wrath of God, and ſo conſidered as if they had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves committed that ſin, <hi>So by the obedience of one many ſhall be made righteous;</hi> made ſo, not only by imputation (that we would have and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, have ſin removed and be ſinners ſtill) but made ſo, that is, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all helps, and with all ſtrength that is neceſſary and ſufficient to forward and perfect thoſe duties of piety, which are required at the hands of a juſtified perſon. For do we not magnifie the Goſpel from the abundance of light and grace which it affordeth? Do we not count the laſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtronger than the firſt? Is not he able to caſt down all the ſtrong holds, all the towring imaginations which fleſh and blood, though tainted in the womb, can ſet up againſt him? And therefore if we be truly (what we profeſs our ſelves) Chriſtians, this weakneſs cannot hurt us; and if it hurt us, it is becauſe we are not Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, If in <hi>Adam</hi> we were all loſt, in Chriſt we are come home and brought nearer to heaven. <hi>Et poſt Jeſum Chriſtum,</hi> when we have given up our names unto Chriſt, and profeſt our ſelves Members of that myſtical Body whereof he is the Head, all our complaints of weakneſs and diſability to move in our ſeveral places, are vain and unprofitable, and injurious to the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is <hi>the power of God unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ro. 1:16.</note> And a groſs and dangerous errour it is, when we run on and pleaſe our ſelves in our evil ways, to complain of our hereditary infirmities, and the weakneſs and imperfection of Nature; for God may yet breath his Complaints and Expoſtulations againſt every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> that will not turn. Though you are weak, though you have received a bruiſe by the Fall of your firſt Parents, yet <hi>in me is your ſtrength,</hi> and then, <hi>Why will ye die O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>

                  <p>The Eternal Immanation of Gods Eternal Being within himſelf,<note place="margin">Immanation of God.</note> was from Eternity to beget a Son like himſelf. God, the Natural Son of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Emanation of Gods Eternal Being without himſelf,<note place="margin">Emanations of God.</note> was in the Beginning to create a Son like himſelf: Man, the Natural Son of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Emanation of Gods Eternal Being without himſelf, was in the Fulneſs of time to incarnate a Son like himſelf: God, the Supernatural Son of Man.</p>
                  <p>The third Emanation of Gods Eternal Being without himſelf, was to Adopt a Son like himſelf: Man, the Adopted Son of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Appetite of Man created,<note place="margin">Appetites of Man.</note> was to be as he was made like unto God: Man, the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Appetite of Man created, was to beget one like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Man, the Son of Man.</p>
                  <p>The third Appetite of Man created, was to love his Neighbour like himſelf; becauſe he was like himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Appetite of Man, was to be renewed in the likeneſs of God, which was defaced by him: Man Regenerate, and born again the Son of God:</p>
                  <p>The End of all Gods Emanations was, that Man ſhould be happy,<note place="margin">Happineſs.</note> and therefore fitted with ſufficient means to attain to that End, and ſo he might if he would, for he was a free Agent to chooſe or to refuſe: There was the Juſtice of a great God.</p>
                  <p>Mans Regular Appetites led him to chooſe Happineſs, but his Irregular Appetites cauſed him to refuſe Happineſs: So did ſome Angels. There was the Injuſtice of a poor Creature.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore God deſigned, by New Propoſals of greater Rewards,<note place="margin">Recovery.</note> to confine his irregular appetites for the Recovery of his loſt Happineſs, and to raiſe him to a more glorious Eſtate, when he might have let him lye as he was utterly loſt for evermore.

                  <p>Therefore God gave him a law of Grace, to love him, worſhip him and truſt him in his Son.</p>

                  <p>This is all that God requires of us, to accept and take this Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Peace proclaimed by Chriſt himſelf and his Ambaſſadours, the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, the Miniſters of this Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>This is the Second Covenant and Teſtament of God, in which all the faithful people are inſtituted to be the Sons and Heirs of God, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

And till this courſe be taken the Church and the World will never be at peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Primitive Times.</note>This Courſe was proſecuted in the firſt four hundred years with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity of Life and Doctrine, by the beſt of Saints, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome intruſion of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> betimes, even in the daies of the Apoſtles, with other workings of men of Antichriſtian ſpirits. But afterwards when Riches and Honour, and with them Pride and Worldly
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:49664:334"/> Intereſts came crowding in amongſt Church-men, out went the old plain way of preaching and living, and in came vain Philoſophy, Oratory, Flattery, Ambition, Perſecution, Diviſion, and what not? moſt unlike to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and contrary to the power of godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Many noble Souls had their eyes fixed, and their hands exerciſed in the old way of Truth, and grieved for the Deviations, which they could not help or reform at all; but proteſted manfully againſt them, like faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſſes and Followers of their Lord and Maſter, and kept the Faith all along which was once delivered to the Saints, and ſome died for it.</p>
                  <p>But at laſt after many overtures of Truth that could not be hid,<note place="margin">Reformation.</note> a greater aſſault was made than ordinary to ſhake off her chains, bring her out of the Dungeon, and rowſe her up againſt Lies, and it was done effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to rare intents and purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Then were the Ages filled with more learned and unbiaſſed men than ever, ſince the Apoſtles daies. Then together with Religion, Arts and Sciences revived and flouriſhed, not without great augmentations of Honour, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Peace that accrued thereunto in the kingdoms of the World, which fared the better for the Church. Yet envious men were never wanting, nor ever will, to ſow Tares; ſtill foggs and vapours ariſe, but the Sun ſhines and climbs his Meridian. The ſtrong man keepeth his houſe, and there is none ſtronger than he to turn him out. The old abominable Hereſies though revived and new ones added, nevertheleſs their monſtrous heads are and will be cut off by the mighty Giants, defenders of the Faith. They ſneak into corners, hang down their heads, dare not ſhew their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty faces, ſave to the ignorant and rebellious; others hiſs them out of doors. The Ancient paths are now more and more enquired for, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Captains lead the way. They that do not follow are nevertheleſs convinced, and cannot but approve of the things they refuſe to practice. Thoſe therefore that aſpire to this Evangelical temper are the nobleſt Souls, and tread in the ſtatelieſt paths of Vertue and Peace, and bring more Souls unto God. For which their labour and moderation they feel the odium of the World, and the unlucky blows of their Enemies; but are commended and defended by God and all good men, for their ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and gallant undertakings.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, what Errors have been of old, there have been ſince by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees brought in ſo many, as threaten corruption of the whole Maſs of Chriſtian Doctrine; As the ſetting up Infallibility and Supremacy, where none ſhould ſeek to be the greateſt; the Idol of the Maſſe, the Worſhip of <hi>Daemons,</hi> the <hi>Diana</hi> for Gain, Purgatory and Pardons; the cheat of Auricular Confeſſions, Images, Penances, Reliques, and innumerable Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, repugnant to the ſimplicity of Goſpel worſhip.

                  <p>Yet am I not without powerful hopes, and do already ſee and wonder at the wiſe and gracious Providence of God, in ſtirring up the ſpirits of Rare men, to baffle the Carnal Fallacies and Superſtitious Riddles that
